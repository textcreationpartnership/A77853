            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Wisemans Divine Observation, mentioned <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.12. may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put any man to some pause and deliberation, that is publishing Books to the world, for two discouragements are there spoken of; and if <hi>Solomon</hi> acted by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit thought good to say so much in those dayes, what would he say to the multitude of Books that since have filled the world?</p>
            <p>The first Discouragement is the endless number of Books, and this is especially true in Polemical Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, for there <hi>bellum è bello nascitur,</hi> one controversie doth not end, but beget another, as one Circle in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter produceth another. And the second is, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risomness
<pb facs="tcp:118921:3"/> that much study or reading bringeth to the flesh; so that it is like <hi>Pauls worldly sorrow that causeth death;</hi> yea this is not the worst; for Books, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially controversal, do produce weariness even to the spiritual part of a man, and do exceedingly <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirit</hi> and <hi>hebetate</hi> the vigorous actings of the soul in a practical gracious manner.</p>
            <p>Now these Considerations would have prevailed with me, not to have troubled the world with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull Controversies, but that formerly an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation lay upon me to finish this Work, to which also I have been often sollicited by worthy and learned Friends; neither will that Objection of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dulling the affectionate part, hold much in this Debate, for it being wholly busied to advance Christ both in what he did and suffered, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to us; hereby not onely the Truth will gain upon the Understanding, but the goodness of it exceedingly sweeten, and ravish the Affections: So that we may say, <hi>Out of this strong one, comes meat,</hi> and who so will seriously walk in this study shall finde it not a barren Wilderness where are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly briars and thorns, but a Land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
            <p>The principal and main Truth asserted in this Book, is the Imputation of Christs Active Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as well, and in the same manner as his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive in the matter of Justification, and that as a Believer is not to divide the Natures, or the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Christ; so neither his Obedience in this great work of our Redemption. A Doctrine that doth openly and plainly proclaim more honour to Christ,
<pb facs="tcp:118921:3"/> and more comfort to the truly humbled sinner, then any of its Competitors. And therefore at first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation out of Popery, generally received by all the Learned and Godly Protestants, and as strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposed and argued against by all the Popish Writers, who concluded it to be the known and avouched Doctrine of the Protestants: But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it came to be doubted of, and at last to be decried and denied, when on the contrary some Papists began to close with it.</p>
            <p>Now the Opposers of this imputed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as it relateth to Christs Active Obedience, go upon different Principles.</p>
            <p>Some (as the <hi>Socinians</hi>) do so deny it, that they raze the very Foundation it self, and at the same time take away the Imputation of Christs Passive and Active Obedience, making both to be a meer humane figment, abhorring from all Reason.</p>
            <p>Others (as the Papists) admit in some sense the Imputation of Christs sufferings, but spend their whole strength against the Imputation of his Righteousness, as if in that we were to be Justified.</p>
            <p>Among the Protestants there are some eminent and Learned men, who have also been for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Non</hi>-Imputation of Christs Active Obedience, as the matter of our Justification; though the number for the Negative, is nothing equal to the number for the Affirmative. Its not my purpose to pass such a severe Condemnation upon the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Dissentients, as I see some learned men do (although the Doctrine asserted in this Book is heavily branded, as being the seed of Antinomia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,
<pb facs="tcp:118921:4"/> and endangering both Law and Gospel, by such who are of a contrary Judgement) but rather am grieved publickly to manifest a difference from such who are eminently usefull in the Church of God. But cordial Esteem and Reverence may be to those, from whom Truth (as we judge) doth necessitate us to dissent. If any of the learned Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers of the Opinion herein affirmed shall conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend so low, as to confute the Arguments propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this Treatise; If I am not convinced by the Light they bring, I shall think it a Duty still to maintain the interest of this so precious and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some a Truth. But Experience may teach us, That though Learning and Understanding will enable us to confirm true Doctrine, yet onely Grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meekness of Spirit, doth fit us for the right ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of it: Therefore because in Replies, we are prone to discover our nakedness, and to strive for a Doctrine more, as it is our Opinion, and as we are concerned in it, rather then as it is the Lords Truth, who as he needeth not our lie, so neither our passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I do think it the most profitable and peaceable way, to propound and propugne the Doctrine <hi>in Thesi,</hi> and whatsoever Arguments are brought against it, nakedly to examine them, without Replies to a whole Book or Discourse that happily may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the Opponent: For what Reader doth not see, that such Contests are spent in personal refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in verbal mistakes, and conduce very little to any mans Edification? Truth being seldom more cleared by those whose Disputations are <hi>in pugno,</hi> and <hi>Syllogismi in calcibus,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> once said of
<pb facs="tcp:118921:4"/> some in his time. Hereby also there are more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations upon Interpretations, and Books upon Books, then upon the Doctrine it self, that is, the principal Subject. Its an happy thing to have a sound Judgement in the matter maintained, and a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit in the manner of maintaining it.</p>
            <p>The Method I follow in this Book, is,</p>
            <p>First, To treat of the Righteousness of God in general, wherein I do maintain against <hi>Socinians,</hi> That there is such an Attribute in God, whereby he is inclined to punish sinners, if there be not Satisfaction given.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Christ by his Sufferings in Soul and Body, as also by his Active Obedience, did truly, perfectly and really, not metaphorically satisfie this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God, against <hi>Socinians</hi> also.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Righteousness of God, as well as his Mercy is demonstrated in our Justification, and that because God is thus Righteous, none can be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to Eternal Life, without perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>Hereupon in the fourth place, We examine what this Righteousness is, first, Negatively, then Positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Negatively, we shew, That its not any supposed Righteousness we can have by Nature, neither is it the Righteousness of the Law, no, nor the Personal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness we have, consisting in Evangelical Graces, and good Works.</p>
            <p>Neither lastly is our Faith, as it is a Work, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us for Righteousness: But Positively, it is an Imputed Righteousness, or a Righteousness without us: The matter whereof is Christs Righteousness,
<pb facs="tcp:118921:5"/> consisting partly in his Sufferings, and partly in his Obedience and Conformity to the Law of God. This is the brief Summe of that which is more largely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Book.</p>
            <p>The Lord make this Tractate serviceable and usefull unto thee for thy Spirituall Edification in Christ.</p>

The word <hi>Righteous,</hi> or Gods <hi>Righteousness</hi> is used several wayes; sometimes its the same with his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Mercy and Benignity,</hi> or at least his <hi>Fidelity and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> in his Promises. Thus <hi>David</hi> often praieth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 71.2. So also <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.17. that God would <hi>deliver him in his righteousness, i. e.</hi> his Mercy and Goodness: And <hi>this Righteousness of God he professeth he will make mention of, and talk of to others.</hi> Indeed some learned men, <hi>Osiander, Cameron,</hi> and all the <hi>Socinians</hi> upon a wicked interest they drive at (but the two former they do it innocently) affirm, That the Righteousnesse of God is never used for that, whereby he punisheth sinners; but for mercy and fidelity, for say the <hi>Socinians,</hi> That whereby God avengeth himself on the wicked, is called <hi>vengeance, fury, anger</hi> or <hi>severity;</hi> But though it must needs be granted that righteousnesse is used so in many places, yet</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Its more properly the <hi>Syriack</hi> use of the word, when it denoteth mercy, although the <hi>Septuagint</hi> do many times translate the Hebrew word for mercy <hi>Chesed,</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">

We observe then from hence,</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Doctrine is of great importance, and my purpose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118921:13"/> to treat of <hi>that righteousness whereby a believer stands justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God,</hi> its necessary to lay this as a foundation.</p>
                  <p>To understand this truth therefore consider these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions following,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">I. Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness two-fold. Of Gods uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</note>First, <hi>Take notice, that the Scripture attributeth a two-fold Righteousness to God, one we may call Ʋniversal, the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</hi> Universal Righteousness is that purity and integrity of his Nature considered absolutely in himself, whereby he is free from all sinne, and so its the same with <hi>Jashar Tam, &amp;c.</hi> Even as <hi>Aristotle</hi> makes all virtue to be in Justice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every virtue consists in a just and due temperament; and as the Apostle makes <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a general to all sinne; so that <hi>Righteousness</hi> thus considered, is the same with <hi>Purity, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> and <hi>Ʋprightness,</hi> whereby whatsoever God doth, he doth it in a condecent and beseeming manner of a God. As <hi>Anselm</hi> said, <hi>Quando parcis justum est ut parcas, quando punis justum est ut punias:</hi> When God spareth he is just, and when he punisheth he is just, that is, in whatsoever God doth, he keeps up that rectitude and holiness, which a God is to do, he doth not shew himself as a creature in those things, but as a God. Now this universal righteousnesse is meant in this place as the foundation, for the Psalmist argueth God will punish the wicked, and defend the upright from his nature, because he is thus universally righteous. This universal Righteousnesse the Scripture describeth partly positively, by the infinite purity and holinesse that is in him. As the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>God is light, and in him there is no darknesse at all,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.5. and partly by his opposition to sinne, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes, then to behold iniquity.</hi> So <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Thou art not a God that hast pleasure in iniquity.</hi> Thus you see we are to apprehend of God, as an infinite, holy, pure and perfect God. Hence <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13. the Apostle saith, <hi>He can never tempt</hi> others actively to sin, or he himself be passively <hi>tempted</hi> to sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</note>In the next place there is his <hi>particular righteousness,</hi> and that may be distributed according to all those relations he taketh upon him, he is the Lord having absolute dominion over all, and so he is a righteous Lord in using that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118921:13"/> He is a <hi>Judge,</hi> and therefore a righteous Judge, as the Apostle cals him; he is a <hi>Father,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour,</hi> John 17.25. cals him <hi>righteous Father;</hi> He is the Governour and Ruler of the world, and all this is administred in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Thus there is no relation, no office or state that God is pleased to assume, as a <hi>King,</hi> an <hi>Husband,</hi> but in all these the Lord works righteously.</p>
                  <p>Again,<note place="margin">Gods particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness divided into several kindes.</note> This particular righteousnesse of his may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into several kindes or <hi>species,</hi> not that there are such mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied beings in God, for he is most simple and pure; but we thus distinguish according to our conceptions: As if a man should look in many glasses at the same time, it would be but one face, onely there would be multiplied reflections, and many faces in the several glasses. Thus Gods essence is one and the same, every thing in God, being God, but the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of objects, maketh a multiplied reflection to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. The kinds of his particular Justice, are (as some make it.)</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His <hi>Mercy,</hi> they make even Gods grace and love a kinde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of his Justice, because its so proper and just, that the chiefest good should be merciful.</p>
                  <p>But in the second place, there is the righteousness of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <hi>fidelity</hi> and <hi>promise,</hi> whereby he keepeth his Word; for in his promises there cometh an obligation, if not of God to us, yet of God to himself: Thus they say he is <hi>sibi debitor</hi> in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he hath promised.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There is Righteousness vindicative,</hi> whereby he punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wicked and ungodly men, as <hi>Moses</hi> describeth God by this righteous property, <hi>That he will in no wise acquit the guilty,</hi> Exod. 34.7. Therefore its but the devils case thou art put into, when thou dreamest only of mercy in God, not at the same time remembring his righteousness.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">II. Justice and righteousnesse properly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto God.</note>
                     <hi>Justice and Righteousness is truly and properly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto God.</hi> There are many things attributed unto God, and that by Scripture language, which yet must be understood improperly, or metaphorically. Thus the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture speaks of his <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>hands:</hi> Thus it saith, <hi>God repents</hi> and is <hi>grieved,</hi> all which are to be understood <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118921:14"/> any imperfection in God: Yea the words <hi>Decree</hi> and <hi>Counsel,</hi> if strictly taken, cannot be given to God, because in their rigorous sense they imply imperfection. Hence <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> said, <hi>Tam impia vox est consilium in Divinis, quam plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas Deitatis.</hi> But righteousnesse is an absolute perfection, implying that which is excellent, and so in the highest degree to be affirmed of God.</p>
                  <p>When I say, Righteousnesse is thus an absolute perfection, I understand it of that general righteousnesse, whereby God is true and holy in his Nature, and in all his wayes: for as for political and civil righteousnesse, even <hi>Aristotle</hi> could say, it was absurd and ridiculous to attribute political virtues to God. Indeed there is a righteousnesse called commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which consists in an equality <hi>inter datum &amp; acceptum,</hi> and this some Jesuites, as <hi>Suarez Disput. de justitia Dei,</hi> would have truly and properly in God. But <hi>Vasquez</hi> another Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite doth solidly oppose it, <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Quaest.</hi> 20. <hi>Dis.</hi> 85. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it would bring down God from his glorious Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and if there cannot be any strict Justice between a Father and a Sonne, a Master and a Servant, much lesse between God and the creature: Its true, all things we take from man and give to God, as to know, to understand and will, they have an imperfection, as they are in man, because they are accidents to man, and of a finite nature, yet we say (seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the imperfection) they may in an eminent and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent consideration be given to God <hi>analogically,</hi> not <hi>univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally;</hi> for a thing may be said to have imperfection in it acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally from the Subject, or essentially in its formal Nature, and what is of this later sort cannot properly be affirmed of God, as to grieve and repent. Now all such Justice as would make God a debtor to the creature, as if he did receive equally for what he hath given, supposeth an imperfection in the very nature thereof, as the Apostle argueth, <hi>Who hath first given to him?</hi> Rom. 11.35. <hi>And what hast thou that thou hast not received?</hi> Whether there be strict Justice between God the Father and Christ in the work of our Redemption, is not in this place to be discoursed on: Its certain, between God and a meer creature there cannot; and therefore all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118921:14"/> those Popish Doctrines of Merit and Satisfaction must fall to the ground. We see then in what sense Justice is attributed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to God, and in what sense not.</p>
                  <p>The third Proposition,<note place="margin">III. Arguments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God.</note>
                     <hi>There are many Arguments that do strongly demonstrate God to be thus righteous.</hi> As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is an inward principle in a mans conscience, whereby he is perswaded of Gods righteousnesse, for what is it that makes a man upon the omitting of grosse sins, such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as the Law of Nature forbids, to have fear and remorse within, but the apprehension of a righteous God, who will call to a dreadful account? The very Heathens had that up often, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, God hath a just and an avenging eye: Therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. its brought as an aggravation against those notorious sinners, <hi>That though they knew the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God,</hi> viz. <hi>That they which commit such things are worthy of death, yet not only do the same, but have pleasure in those that do them.</hi> The Gentiles knew this judgement of God. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Their consciences are said to accuse:</hi> If then you ask, How can it be proved God is a righteous God? I answer, From thy own heart; thy own soul; in this respect it is <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliter Christiana,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> said: Oh then, where will those wretched sinners appear, who live in all prophanenesse and injustice, though a conscience within them crieth aloud that God is righteous! How canst thou stop thy ears to these loud cries? All thy mirth and jollity cannot raze this out, There is a righteous God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The providential government of this world, so vast, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> consisting of men so unruly and carried by their lusts, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate a righteous God.</hi> The world would be a <hi>Babel,</hi> would be an hell, had not God established an order of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours and Inferiours, of Governours and governed, as <hi>David</hi> acknowledged it was <hi>the Lord subdued his people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him,</hi> Psal. 18.47. And when God <hi>touched the peoples hearts, then they followed Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.26. Thus <hi>David</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Gods reigning in the world, that he is <hi>the King of the earth, and that he judgeth righteously,</hi> Psal. 67.4. So that the harmony of a musical instrument doth not more palpably demonstrate the art of an Artificer, then the government of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118921:15"/> this world, doth the righteousnesse of the Governour, who is God; If a City, if a Nation cannot subsist without righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, <hi>For, take away Righteousnesse</hi> (saith <hi>Augustine,) and what are Kingdoms but great robberies? how much lesse can the world abide without a righteous preserver of it?</hi> Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is said <hi>to go before God,</hi> Psal. 85.13. because that makes way for him in all his works.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The Scriptures they are an undeniable and infallible principle to prove his righteousnesse. This is proclaimed in many places, <hi>Psal.</hi> 71.19. <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.6. Indeed when we look upon the divine dispensations of Gods works in the world, beholding the godly sometimes in an afflicted condition, and the wicked in a prosperous; we are apt to question the righteousnesse of God. Through these waters of afflictions, that which is strait seemeth crooked, as in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> But then come we to the Word of God, there righteousnesse is affirmed in all his wayes, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever our thoughts may be. The man that judgeth by the eye, thinketh the Sunne lesse then the world, but the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer judging by principles of art, knoweth it is otherwise. Thus while we judge of Gods wayes according to humane principles, we call that unrighteous, which by Scripture light will appear most just.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. The righteousnesse that Angels and <hi>Adam</hi> was created in; yea that Image of God which is repaired in every godly man, consisting in <hi>Righoeousnesse and true Holinesse,</hi> this doth necessarily inferre Gods righteousnesse, for as the Psalmist argueth, <hi>He that made the eye, shall not he see? He that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth man knowledge, shall not he know?</hi> Thus he that makes man righteous, shall not he much more be righteous? Is not this called the Image and likenesse of God? And why so? but because this is a representation of his Divine Essence. The creatures represent a God, but this Image doth a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God: If therefore thou seest any man working righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and loving righteousnesse in all his words and actions, know that righteousnesse is much more in the cause, in the fountain, which is God himself.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. The particular effects of Gods primitive Justice, or his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118921:15"/> judgements which he executeth in the world do also demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate his righteousnesse. God is not so in heaven, but his judgements, sometimes extraordinary, as in drowning of the world, burning the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his ordinary ones, do teach every one, that God is not only merciful, but just, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.14. <hi>Judgement and justice are the habitation of thy throne. Isa.</hi> 28.17. By the description thereof judgement laid to the line, is excellently shewed the exactness of justice God keeps to in destroying, he is as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in destroying the mercies of a people, as an Artificer is to build an house.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Gods justice is evidently seen, in that the godly are not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> acquitted without satisfaction through Christ; even the righteousnesse of God makes way for all the glorious effects of his mercy, when that is satisfied then comes pardon of sins, and salvation: but of this more largely afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, The appointing of judgement and everlasting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to all impenitent sinners, will then convince all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> world of his righteousnesse, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25. <hi>Paul</hi> preaching of this made <hi>Felix tremble,</hi> and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>Jude v.</hi> 15. speak terribly of this argument; Oh let not ungodly men take their ease and pleasure alwayes! Think of this righteous God, that hath appointed such a righteous day: as thy works have been so will God render to thee: Shall not unquenchable fire, eternal gnashing of teeth and everlasting howling in tormenting flames make thee afraid? <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> made a Law, <hi>That whosoever would not worship his Image should be thrown into a fiery fornace,</hi> and this did so terrifie every one, that none refused but the three Worthies; yet this fornace was not like to hell, whose flames never go out. Take heed then of abusing mercy, for this will bring thee at last into the hands of justice: Oh then there will be righteousnesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mercy, not a drop of water to cool the top of the tongue! Oh wretched and seduced sinners! Will your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pleasures recompence those eternal torments? Are thy sins as great a good to thee, as hell will be a losse and torment?</p>

If the Heathen could say, that in respect of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial creatures and the knowledge of them, our understandings were but like the Owles eyes to the Sun, dazled more then inlightened: How much more is this true of God! What is the reason then that so many stumble at those Points in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, about Gods permission and suffering of sin to be? about his discriminating of persons by Election and Reprobation? about the induration of sinners and punishing one sinne with another? about the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne to all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity? In these Points many have charged God with inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice only, because they judge of God by principles of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane justice. But it is well observed by <hi>Musculus,</hi> Its hard (saith he) to understand what a just God is, because its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to know what God is: Therefore when such opinions come to be discussed by thee, raise up thy minde to think of God, as a God; he is not a creature, he is not a sworn Judge tied by Laws, he is not under a Superiour to command and prescribe him, and therefore those things are justly done by God, because he hath an absolute Dominion and Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which if a creature should do, it would be unjust. That is excellent of <hi>Gregory</hi> to this purpose, <hi>Qui in factis Dei rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem non invenit, in infirmitate suâ invenit cur rationem non inveniat.</hi> He that in Gods Works cannot finde a reason of them, may easily finde in his infirmities a reason why he cannot finde a reason. To suffer sinne to be when we can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, this no creature may do; but God doth it justly. So to harden another man in sinne, no creature may do, if he could do it; but God as a just Judge doth it, not indeed by infusing wickedness, but by withdrawing or denying molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace. So to cooperate to that action, to which the deformity of sinne doth necessarily adhere, a creature may not do it; but God being the supream Lord, and not tied by such laws as men are, he therefore may as a God do that, which a man cannot do without sinne; yet this is not to be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118921:17"/> understood, as if God had an absolute power to do any thing against his Wisdom, and his Holy and Righteous Will, as is to be shewed; only this is brought to silence those prophane disputers of the world, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. who would bring God to account, and not submit to him, as having a supream Dominion over all. As many points in Religion, so the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral passages of Gods Providence in this world, have made men doubt and dispute about his Righteousness, That it should fare well with a wicked man, and he prosper in his sinnes, and on the contrary fare as ill with a godly man, so that be shall even <hi>perish in his righteousness,</hi> Eccles. 7.15. or at least as the same wise man observeth, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.2. <hi>All things fall alike to all, even to the righteous and the wicked,</hi> &amp;c. This consideration hath not only amazed the Heathens, but we see <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> staggering under it; and indeed if we consult with humane principles, we undertake to measure the vast heavens with a little finger: but go we to Gods Word, there we see admirable arguments, declaring Gods Righteousness in all these Providences, especially that we must suspend our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments till the last day, when God will manifest to the world his Righteousness: For as it is in the Scripture, if a man should make a full <hi>period</hi> in some verse, where there is but a <hi>comma</hi> or a <hi>colon,</hi> it would be blasphemy; As to take that verse of the Psalmist, <hi>Thou art not a God that hast pleasure in iniquity;</hi> if a man should make a full stop, reading <hi>Thou art not a God.</hi> this would be blasphemy; but if he reade to the period, its excellent sense: So whosoever judgeth of Gods Righteousness by his Providential passages, before God hath made a full end, he may charge God foolishly. Learn we then from the Scripture, to judge with fear and reverence about Gods Righteousness, believing him to be Just and Righteous in all his Works, even when we cannot demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it.</p>

Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice then being a property in God, its the same with his Nature: and if you say, How can God be just and mercifull to, if both be his infinite Essence? I answer, Very well, for these two Properties as essential in God, are not opposite to one another; indeed the effects of justice and mercy are sometimes contrary, but the Attributes themselves are not, of which more afterwards, as also how farre the effects of his Justice are natural, and yet free to him.</p>
                  <p>The sixth Proposition, <hi>God is so Righteous,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">VI. Gods Nature and Will the Rule of all Righteousness.</note>
                     <hi>that his Nature and his Will is the rule and measure of all righteousness.</hi> Even as in artificial things, therefore this or that work is done right or artificially, because conformable to the Idea of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer which he hath in his minde: Or as <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith, Gods knowledge (<hi>viz.</hi> practical) is the cause of all created truth, and the rule of it, so also Gods holy Will is the rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all created good and righteousness; a thing being therefore just, because consonant to that eternal rule of Righteousness. Indeed there are somethings that are just and righteous in their nature intrinsecally, as to love God, to do righteously with man, and these are not just because God Wils them, but they are just, and therefore he Wils them; yea such is his Perfection that he cannot but Will them, neither can he dispense to the contrary: Though even these things are therefore just, because conformable to Gods nature, or that eternal Law of Righteousness within him; for seeing they are not the first, and uncreated righteousness, but created, they must needs have a rule to measure them by. 2. There are righteous things, not from their nature, but meerly from a command, and so are righteous because com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as in the forbearing to eat of the forbidden fruit; so all the Levitical worship, these had no intrinsecal holiness, but therefore they were good, because required. Lastly, <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardin</hi> addeth a third kinde, which he cals <hi>Justa mixta,</hi> mixed or compounded of both the other: For although it was not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118921:18"/> intrinsecally evil for <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of the forbidden fruit, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aside the command, yet supposing the command, then it was intrinsecally evil for a creature not to obey the command of his Creator. Now as this is a mixed righteous good thing, so Gods Will about it is mixed, the one part being willed because righteous, the other righteous because willed. And this very consideration must needs convince that God cannot Will any thing unrighteously, for how can the Rule of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness be unrighteous? we may better say, there cannot be any sinne, then that God can Will it, for if he should Will it, it would not be a sinne; as if the arrow were the mark, it could never miss. Oh what obediential resignation should this teach us, resign thy self unto Gods Will, as that which is most Righteous, and wherein there cannot be the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinacy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">VII. God cannot do a thing against his Just and Righteous Will.</note>The seventh Proposition, <hi>We may not apprehend in God any such absolute power, whereby he may do a thing against his just and righteous Will.</hi> There is by the Schoolmen large Disputes about Gods absolute power, whether he may not forgive sin to a sinner, though he remain impenitent; and with the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> Whether God may not absolutely pardon sinne freely without any satisfaction; but howsoever men may speak boldly here, intruding to things above mans reach, yet this must be concluded on, that it is a great dishonour to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend a power in God to do any thing against the rules of his Wisdom and Justice: (As when some Schools determine, that God may command the hatred of himself, yea that by such an hatred of God a man may <hi>mereri,</hi> merit;) for that were to conceive him a God that had power to sinne, and so to be no God: Therefore some have wholly rejected that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Potestas absoluta</hi> and <hi>ordinata</hi> in God, for if it be so (saith <hi>Bonaventure</hi>) then there would be a <hi>potestas</hi> in God <hi>inordinatè agere,</hi> to act and work inordinately: but it cannot be denied, that God hath a power to do many things, which yet he will not do; as Christ said, his Father could send him legions of Angels, and so he was able to raise up children to <hi>Abraham,</hi> even out of stones; but if God should do these things, then he would do them justly also, and righteously;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118921:18"/> so that do them or do them not, in each God is Righteous. And thus <hi>Scotus</hi> well explained that distinction, That there is no <hi>potentia absoluta</hi> in God, contradistinguished to <hi>ordinata,</hi> for if God should work otherwaies then he did, that <hi>potentia</hi> would be <hi>ordinata.</hi> Let us not therefore give liberty to end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less disputes about an absolute power in God, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend, but satisfie our selves with that Will and ordered Power of his that is manifested in the Word. We may say of God and his Attributes, as <hi>Austin</hi> said of the Trinity, <hi>Dicimus tres Personas, non ut diceretur, sed ne taceretur.</hi> And that is a truth, <hi>Deus verius cogitatur quam dicitur, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius est quàm cogitatur.</hi>

                  <p>The eighth Proposition,<note place="margin">VIII. Righteousness when attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God is taken three waies.</note>
                     <hi>This doth much tend to the clearing of the true doctrine about Gods Righteousness:</hi> Righteousness when attributed to God is taken three waies: Sometimes for an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute in God, the same with his Nature: Thus in the text and <hi>Ps.</hi> 145.17. Sometimes it is taken for the actual administration of Righteousness, for the execution of his just judgements, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.15. Lastly, for the judgements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.15. <hi>Isa.</hi> 16.5. Even as the mercy of God is sometimes taken either for the Attribute of God, or for his actual compassion, or for the effects of his mercy, and so Gods will is either taken for the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the power to will, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the act of willing, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the object willed. Now when we speak of Gods Righteousness, its of great consequence to know whether we mean his Attribute of Righteousness, or the effects, for these two exceedingly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as in these considerations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Its a lawfull and ordinary prayer which the Church often useth, whereby she deprecateth the Justice of God, and flieth to his Mercy: They supplicate, that God would not deal with them according to his Justice, but according to his Mercy; Now if in this prayer, by Justice should be meant Gods Attribute, there would be some blasphemy in the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for God cannot but be Just, and deal justly: we may as well pray, that God would not be God. But if by Justice we understand the effects of Justice, then the prayer is very good and sound, <hi>viz.</hi> that God would not, though Just in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118921:19"/> his Nature, yet bring such effects of his wrath upon us, that may overwhelme us. We pray not then against the Attribute of God, but against the effects of it, which are subject to the liberty of his Will, whenas his Attributes are not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The effects of Gods justice are various and different, there are more upon some then upon another, but his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute cannot be so. When God executed some extraordinary punishments upon some notorious sinners, as the old world, the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> there we may say, God wrought more effects of his Justice upon those sinners then others, yet we cannot say, God is more just in punishing of them, then in other wicked men. Even as it is in Gods mercy, take it for an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, we cannot say, God is more or less mercifull; but if for the effects of it, then he is so in his Justice, God is alwaies alike just, he is not more just at one time, then at another; but the effects of his Justice may be more at one time, and in one place then another.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence it followeth that Righteousness taken for the effects of it, are not the same with God, neither is there a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural necessity of them; but if taken for an Attribute, its the same with God, and so God had been a just God, though there had been no creatures made, no sinne to be punished. As he is a Wise God, and a mercifull God, and a Mighty God, though he had not demonstrated any effects thereof. God is necessarily Righteous, but he doth not necessarily work such and such effects of his Righteousness.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If Gods Righteousness be taken, as often it is in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for the effects of his righteousness, then there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety between them, and the effects of his mercy. To be preserved alive by Mercy, and to be destroyed by Justice are contrary, and so cannot be together upon the same subject. Now, though the effects be thus contrary, yet the Attributes from whence they flow are not contrary, for God is both at the same time, infinitely Righteous, and infinitely Merciful, there is no contrariety between them, but the effects of these may be in such an high degree, that they can never be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as a man cannot be saved and damned at the same time, for these are the effects of Mercy and Justice in an high degree.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118921:19"/> Indeed if we consider some effects of these Attributes in a more remiss degree, then they may be together, and in many things God doth shew forth both his Mercy and Justice toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea even in hell God (they say) doth some work of mercy, because he doth punish <hi>citra condignum,</hi> he breaketh not out to the utmost of punishment sinne doth deserve.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, If we take Gods Righteousness <hi>ad intra,</hi> as an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute in him, we cannot say that God hath less of that, then of Mercy, if that also be taken as an Attribute; God is as just as he is mercifull, and as mercifull as he is just. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when it is said, <hi>James</hi> 2.13. <hi>Mercy rejoyceth against judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and when God is described mercifull, ready to forgive, but slow to wrath, these places are to be understood of the effects of these Attributes, not the Attributes themselves, for so God is no more inclining to Mercy then to Justice, they being both Infinite Perfections in him: But if we speak of the effects, then in this life, God is more ready to shew forth the effects of his love and long suffering, as at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he will more demonstrate the effects of his Justice. This is the time of mercy, then the time of Justice. Lastly, It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied but that the Scripture speaking of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding holy men with eternal life, doth attribute it to Gods justice, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>He is faithfull and just to forgive us our sinnes.</hi> Heb. 6.10. <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget your labour of love.</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.6. where its made <hi>a righteous thing with God to punish the persecutors of the Church,</hi> but to give <hi>rest to them that are troubled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being clear, we are to examine whether Justice be here taken strictly, or meerly improperly, so as to signifie no more then the truth and fidelity of his promise, insomuch that if he should not bestow heaven upon the godly, he would be only unjust in his Word; not that he owed a godly man hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and had received of him equivalent for it. Some Papists, especially <hi>Suarez</hi> (as you heard) contends for this earnestly, That there is a true proper commutative justice between God and the godly man, when he is made happy. But this is too proud and high: 1. From the transcendency of the reward to our godly actions. In all strict justice there must be an
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118921:20"/> equality between the thing given and received, but now hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is so far above all our duties, that if all the glory of the world should be given to a man for lifting up a straw, it would not be comparable. <hi>Genes.</hi> 31. <hi>I am less then the least of thy mercies,</hi> saith <hi>Jacob,</hi> then much more less then the greatest; if a man be less then a drop of water, much less then heaven it self: so <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>These present sufferings are not worthy to that eternal weight of glory.</hi> 2. Our condition is such, that there cannot be any strict justice between God and us, because what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we have it is his gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>Who hath first given to him?</hi> So that although God vouchsafe grace to us, yea and makes a promise to this grace, yet he doth not lose his dominion over us. We are his servants still, and therefore the more we have, the more we are bound to be thankfull to him, and not to stand on terms of justice. Therefore we see the Scripture attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both Election, Vocation, Justification and Salvation, all these from the first to the last, solely to his grace and good pleasure. And hence it is that eternal life is called the gift of God, and an inheritance, which exclude any such thoughts as may crave it by way of justice.</p>
                  <p>Use of Instruction, How unwise they are for their salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who look upon God as mercifull only, not at all attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his justice, whereas you have heard God is equally Righteous, and that he is no more mercifull then just! Hence you have threatnings as well as promises: Why then doth not this wound thy heart more? Is there not an hell as well as an heaven? Is there not damnation as well as salvation? Why then dost thou hope alwaies for one, and never fearest the other? Now indeed mercy compasseth you about, by mercy you eat, drink and sleep, but at the day of judgement Justice will inviron you, then Justice prepares eternal torments, then Justice crieth aloud, <hi>Depart ye cursed;</hi> above, below, within, without, thou seest nothing but the effects of a just and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God.</p>

                  <p>The love of God is two fold:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. General and common, which is carried out to a creature as his creature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                     <hi>That God being righteous in his Nature doth only love righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse in the creature.</hi> The righteous God loveth a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man. To manifest the truth of this, consider</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> First, That as we mentioned about Gods righteousnesse, so also about mans, <hi>There is a two-fold consideration of it:</hi> First, <hi>General,</hi> as it signifieth the rectitude and conformity of the whole man to Gods Law; and in this sense its most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently used in the Scripture, and so is the same with a holy, pure and upright man. This righteousnesse <hi>Adam</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in, and is called the image of God; for although there was among the <hi>Romans</hi> righteous men, as <hi>Fabricius</hi> of whom they said, they might sooner turn the Sunne out of its course, then move him from what is righteous; and among the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> there was <hi>Aristides</hi> the just, so called by all for his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, yet these did not arrive to the righteous men the Scripture speaks of, who are sanctified in their Natures, and have the Image of God by his gracious power repaired in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are the parts and kindes of righteousnesse in a more particular manner, as it consists in dealing between man and man: This is distinguished from godlinesse, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.12. and thus among the moral Philosophers, justice is made a special distinct moral virtue, from other virtues: By this a man hath a constant will and purpose to give to every one that is due to him; without this Societies cannot consist, and whosoever is righteous the former way, is also in this later way, he is righteous in his words, just and faithful in all his actions, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. <hi>He that is born of God doth righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>The proper Nature of Righteousnesse lieth in a conformity to the Law of God,</hi> which is the rule of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118921:21"/> even as the proper formal nature of sinne, lieth in the transgression of the Law. Indeed Gods righteous nature and his will, is the original and archetypal rule, but the will of God revealed is the ectypal or copy of that original, so that if we would judge whether an action be righteous,<note place="margin">Many things go to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</note> or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son righteous, we must gather it by his conformity to the Law of God. Indeed there go many things to righteousnesse,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An integrity or universality of the parts of it, called <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> therefore the Image of God; so that as a mans body is not an hand or foot, but the comprehension of all; This neither is righteousnesse in one action, or in one kinde, or at one time, but there must be an universality of these.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As universality, so there must be a <hi>debitum,</hi> a due or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> an obligation for the Subject to have it, as in the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a meer nesciency is not a sinne, but an ignorance of that we ought to know; so in the will a meer <hi>non volition,</hi> or omission is not a sin, unlesse it be of that which is due either to God or man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There must be purity of intention, a love of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for righteousnesse sake. As <hi>Anselm</hi> defined <hi>Justitia</hi> to be <hi>Rectitudo voluntatis propter ipsam servata:</hi> whatsoever is not done for righteousnesse sake, and out of care to it, but for applause, profit, or other carnal ends, that is not true righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Which is the formal nature of righteousnesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> there must be a commensuration or adequation to the rule of righteousnesse; so that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> are all one, that which is righteous, and that which is established by a Law. Now the righteousnesse of the Pharisees, though so highly esteemed amongst men, yet was rejected by God. As a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten post shineth in a dark night, but when the Sun ariseth, then all know what it is. Thus when Christ by the light of his Ministry discovered what true righteousnesse was, that of the Pharisees was manifested to be light and empty, for their righteousnesse failed in universality, because they omitted many things, and such as were chiefest failed in the debt and obligation of it: Christ asked, <hi>Who had required those things at their hands:</hi> it failed in the purity of intention, <hi>for they did
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118921:22"/> all things to be seen of men.</hi> Lastly, it failed in conformity to a Law, for being no commandment was for many things they did in which they placed righteousnesse, there could not be any conformity to a Law: for without a Law as there is no transgression, so no righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, <hi>There are persons who are truly and really righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> This is to be noted, because the Papists generally calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate the Protestants, as if they held there were no righteous persons, with an inherent righteousnesse. Among Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants (say they) a man hath no righteousnesse, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal and imputed one; so that though a man be full of iniquity, yet he is a righteous man, because Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is made to him, but this is a notorious reproach; for although we say indeed, that the holiest men which live, have not a holinesse inherent in them, whereby they stand justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before God, yet they have a true personal, inward, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual righteousnesse, as also an outward actual one, which doth in truth, though not in perfection agree with the rule; and this is clear, for the Scripture giveth both the <hi>titulum,</hi> and the <hi>rem,</hi> the title and nature of righteousnesse to them. The title thus, <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Noah, Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> are said to be <hi>righteous persons,</hi> and it gives the nature of it to them, in that it saith, <hi>They walked in all the Commandments of the Lord unblameably,</hi> as also <hi>in that they are renewed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the image of God,</hi> which consists in <hi>righteousnesse and true holinesse,</hi> for although this righteousnesse they have be not perfect, yet its true: So that hereby even God himself distinguisheth them from sinners and ungodly persons, and although sinne cleaveth to them, yet they are denominated righteous from the more noble and excellent quality in them, as we say a man is rational, though his body be void of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. There are then persons sanctified by the grace of God, who are truly and indeed righteous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> But yet fourthly, <hi>God loveth none to Justification and special favour with him, unlesse he have a perfect compleat righteousness answering the rule, which because the most righteous men on earth have not, therefore they need a righteousnesse without them to be made theirs.</hi> Hence <hi>Paul</hi> Phil. 3. <hi>would not be found in his own
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118921:22"/> righteousnesse, but that which is by faith in Christ:</hi> And <hi>David</hi> also prayeth <hi>God would not enter into judgement with him, for then no flesh would be justified,</hi> Psal. 143.2. We must not then trust or depend upon this inherent righteousnesse of ours, but flie to an imputed righteousnesse. As <hi>Luther</hi> expressed it, We must go from an active righteousnesse to a passive, from that we do to that we receive,<note place="margin">Wherein Gods love to Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness doth appear.</note> for God requireth a perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse which we have not: But of this more in its proper place. Come we to shew wherein Gods love to righteousnes doth appear.</p>
                  <p>And first, <hi>There cannot be a better testimony of it, then the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Law of God, or his Commandments, which in all particulars requireth exact and perfect righteousnesse.</hi> The holinesse of Gods Word doth demonstrate the Divinity of it; All the moral Philosophers have not attained to the shadow of that righteousnesse, which the Word commands; this requireth inward and outward righteousnesse; this commands a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous heart, and righteous thoughts, and righteous affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a pure spring as well as pure streams. Hence it is when a man comes to be sanctified, that with <hi>Paul, He delights in the Law of God,</hi> Rom. 7. and with <hi>David accounts it above all riches and sweetnesse,</hi> Psal. 19, because its such a spiritual and holy Law: but wicked and unsanctified men they cannot endure it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Gods love to righteousnesse appeareth in all his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hatred and wrath against sinne.</hi> Its that onely which God hateth and will punish to all eternity; God hateth not any, because afflicted, poor or miserable; yea he pitieth such, but if thou art wicked, then his soul is set against thee: Look in the Scripture, and whensoever you reade of Gods hatred, anger, vengeance and fury, its alwayes because men have sinned against him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 47.7. <hi>Thou lovest righteousnesse and hatest iniquity.</hi> These two are necessarily joyned together: Even as we are commanded <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>to hate that which is evil.</hi> The word signifieth, <hi>to hate it, as we do hell it self,</hi> to be as unwilling to sinne as to be damned, and then <hi>cleave to that which is good.</hi> The word signifieth <hi>to be glued to it with inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and adhering affections;</hi> if we then would know how
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118921:23"/> greatly God loves righteousnesse, it will appear by his wrath and punishments of unrighteousnesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 7.11. <hi>God is angry with the wicked all the day long.</hi> There is not an hour, a moment wherein God is not provoked against a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, especially Gods hatred against sinne, is seen in ordaining everlasting, easlesse torments, and that for the least sinne, so that the least vain thought, or idle word, if not repented of, God hath appointed eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as their reward, though thou hast committed no other sinne. Therefore its not onely against hainous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious sinnes, but even the least that God hath prepared those eternal flames of hell. Hence we see his fury against the Angels, throwing them into everlasting chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and meerly because of sinfull thoughts, and corrupt motions of the will, for they being spiritual substances, were not capable of other sins: Oh then, let every one tremble at the commission of the least sin, seeing God hath declared such anger against it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Gods love to righteous persons appeareth in all his mercifull and gracious Works he vouchsafeth to them.</hi> They onely are the object of his Love and Delight, to such only he doth communicate himself. As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the Scripture we see his constant approbation and complacency is in such, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous;</hi> he knoweth it by approbation, by love and special blessings vouchsafed to it: So that all the way of a righteous man, not onely some actions, but his whole conversation is pleasing to him, we may say the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what is spoken of the wicked; God is pleased with the righteous all the day long. That is a remarkable expression, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.15. which for the excellency of it is alledged 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and his ears open to their cries.</hi> The eyes of the Lord are upon them, not towards them, to shew the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and care of God, he never takes his eye off them, yea both eyes and ears are for them. This (to speak after men) implieth that God is (as it were) taken up wholly with them, as if there were no other work to be done in the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118921:23"/> world by God, but his attendance and care over the righteous: Oh then, how happy are such that walk in all Righteousnesse! The eyes of God are alwayes upon them for good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As his great love is thus towards them, so his preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and protection of them is admirable in all calamities and miseries. Thus <hi>Noah,</hi> because a <hi>righteous person,</hi> and a <hi>Preacher of Righteousnesse,</hi> hath an <hi>Ark</hi> to preserve him, when the whole world is drowned; and so <hi>Lot,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.8. a righteous man, and whose <hi>righteous soul was vexed,</hi> tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, as if he had been in hell (the word may so signifie) The Scripture saith concerning him, <hi>That the Lord knoweth how to deliver such.</hi> Prov. 11.8. <hi>The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his room:</hi> Yea, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.18. <hi>The wicked is said to be a ransom for the righteous,</hi> that is, God will give up many wicked men to destruction to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a righteous man. Are not then those promises or Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture truths powerful demonstrations of Gods love to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Gods love to the righteous doth further appear, in that for their sakes he keeps off judgements from the wicked of the world.</hi> As <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. we have a full proof of it, when God conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended so farre, as to say, <hi>For ten righteous mens sake, he would not have destroyed Sodome and Gomorrah;</hi> So that righteous men are the pillars and a foundation of the Land: Therefore the Prophet complains, <hi>Isa.</hi> 51.1. <hi>The righteous man perisheth, and none layeth it to heart:</hi> Why should they lay to heart the death of a righteous man? Because for his sake God continueth many mercies, and withall his death is a sad Prognostick of imminent calamities: Therefore its added, <hi>The righteous is gathered;</hi> A Metaphor either from those who gather up their Jewels and Plate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when a fire is rising upon an house, or else from the Shepherd that gathereth his Flocks together into some place of defence, when he seeth a violent storme coming.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>God loveth the righteous, in that his goodnesse is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vouchsafed to them, but to their posterity also.</hi> So accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118921:24"/> is righteousnesse to God, that where he findes it, not only the persons themselves, but their seed after them shall be blessed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.22. <hi>The seed of the righteous are delivered.</hi> When righteous parents are dead and forgotten by all their neighbours, yet God remembreth such; and though their seed be exposed to the world, and all do forget their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, yet God will not: especially that famous place is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be forgotten, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.25. where <hi>David</hi> professeth, That in all the experience he had from his younger years to his old age, <hi>He never saw the righteous forsaken, or his seed begging bread.</hi> This place hath much exercised the thoughts of Interpreters, for we reade <hi>David</hi> himself asking for bread of <hi>Abimelech</hi> the Priest; and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whose soul was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into heaven, say at the rich mans gate, begging even for very crums of bread. To this many reply several answers, Some place it upon <hi>Davids experience,</hi> he doth not say, that in no age the righteous or his seed may not beg bread; but he in all his time had not observed it. Others place it in the nature of <hi>beggery,</hi> that is, say they, a punishment and a curse by the Law of God; and therefore though the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous may be so poor, and their seed also, as to need suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from others, yet the curse of this poverty, which is called beggery, is taken from them. Thus some reconcile that seeming contradiction, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.4. where God promiseth so to blesse them, <hi>that there shall be no poor amongst them;</hi> yet at <hi>vers.</hi> 7. he saith, <hi>If there be any poor amongst you, thou shalt release unto him when seven years come,</hi> &amp;c. By the former poor is meant a Beggar, one that is cursed by Gods Law; By the second, any needy person that wants relief from others.</p>
                  <p>Others they answer this difficulty from the word <hi>[forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken]</hi> They never saw the righteous forsaken, nor his seed, though begging bread, not forsaken, because if God doth not alwayes provide necessaries for them, yet be doth support them inwardly, and blesse them with a contented spirit, as the Martyr said, <hi>If they took away his food from him, God would take away his stomack from him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others, They answer it from the exposition of the word
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118921:24"/>
                     <hi>righteous,</hi> which (say they) doth not signifie a strict, just, righteous man, but a liberal beneficent man; for by liberal things a liberal man is said to stand, <hi>Isa.</hi> 38 8. and many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of earthly comforts are made to such as are compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to those that are in necessities.</p>
                  <p>Some answer it from the Hebrew word <hi>seeking</hi> or <hi>begging,</hi> which signifieth such an anxious, careful seeking as Heathens do, without any faith in God, and any hope to speed.</p>
                  <p>Others distinguish between an <hi>occasional begging,</hi> and a <hi>constant, perpetual way. David</hi> begg'd bread of <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Nabal;</hi> so <hi>Elisha</hi> of the widow of <hi>Sarepta:</hi> but this was occasional not perpetual.</p>
                  <p>But lastly, That which is most satisfactory is, that such places which either promise or declare the outward prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the righteous, are to be understood by light from other places of Scripture, and that is, They shall never fall into such outward calamities, unlesse when God seeth it good for them, for sometimes chastisements and afflictions are better then mercies, as <hi>Austin</hi> said, There was <hi>crudelis quaedam mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sericordia,</hi> and <hi>misericors quaedam saevitia.</hi> This is certain, when wealth and outward comforts are good for them and their seed, they shall alwayes have them; and if they were as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to them as Christ is, God would no more deny that to them, then he doth Christ. But you must know these promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of earthly mercies are more frequent in the Old Testament, as being more sutable to that dispensation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>God loveth righteousnesse, because in and by that God doth comfort and support the hearts of those that are so.</hi> Its observable what is said, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.8. of a righteous man, <hi>His righteousnesse shall go before him,</hi> i. e. that shall make way for his acceptance with God and man. There shall not be any Law or barre to him from coming into Gods presence. He shall not with <hi>Est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her</hi> say, <hi>I have not been called into the Kings presence,</hi> and so make it hazardous to go in unto him. Their righteousnesse, as you see in <hi>Job,</hi> was the testimony or evidence they had against all fears and doubts. Hence <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.32. <hi>His secret is said to be with the righteous;</hi> and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.14. it is called <hi>the brest-plate of righteousnesse.</hi> This is a good Nurse in our old
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118921:25"/> age. This is like young <hi>Abishag</hi> in old <hi>Davids</hi> bosome: as <hi>Hezekiah, Remember, O Lord, that I have walked before thee in truth and uprightnesse of heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>God will crown righteous men with everlasting glory.</hi> If <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> God saith in the end of his dispensations even in this world, they shall discern between the righteous and the unrighteous, how much more will this be true at the day of Judgement, when the <hi>goats shall be placed at the left hand, and commanded to depart into everlasting fire, but the sheep and the righteous shall be called to inherit that glory which was of old prepared for them!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse of Instruction.</hi> Doth the Lord love righteousnesse, then do thou exercise thy self in the way of righteousnesse all the day long, both universal and particular righteousness? Conform thy whole man to Gods rule, live not according to thy lusts, to the principles of the world, but according to Gods will; Be righteous in thy words, in thy actions, in all thy dealings. Beware no such wicked thought arise in thy heart, as to think, If I deal righteously, if I do not lie, cheat, defraud, I shall not enrich my self, I shall lose such and such advantages. Its a Proverb raised from hell, <hi>He that useth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty or righteousnesse shall die a beggar;</hi> I grant that in this wicked world, a mans righteousnesse may hinder him of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny advantages, which unjust men will greedily imbrace, and therefore <hi>Thrasymachus</hi> the Heathen called Righteousnesse <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a general and noble folly. But stay till the end of all, till the day of Judgement, then you will see the difference God will make between the righteous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, then the unjust will vomit up all this sweet morsel, and will become a beggar indeed, crying for a drop of water, and cannot have it.</p>

                  <p>And the first Objection usually raised is this, <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>How can God be said to love Righteousness, to approve and command that only, seeing that in the Scripture we see him commanding those things that seem to be very unjust and against nature?</hi> The famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances are, 1. <hi>Gods command to</hi> Abraham, <hi>that he should offer up his only son</hi> Isaac, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2. <hi>Was not this to will</hi> Abraham <hi>should do that which was most unnatural?</hi> 2. They instance in the Israelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.35. Where <hi>God commands</hi> Moses <hi>to speak to the Israelites, that they borrow Jewels and Vessels of Gold of the Egyptians, as if they intended to restore them again, whereas thereby they robbed and spoiled the Egyptians. Is not this for God to allow and command thefts and lying?</hi> The third instance is from <hi>Hosea</hi> 1.2. Where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118921:26"/> is commanded to <hi>take a wife of whoredoms, i. e.</hi> an eminent and notorious whore, <hi>and to beget children of whoredoms.</hi> And <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>the Prophet did thus. Now this seemeth to be a very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and scandalous thing that the Prophet is commanded to do; and therefore by these instances, How can we say God doth so love Righteousness that he hateth all iniquity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But these texts may easily be cleared.</p>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> For the first, Gods command to <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his son, was not absolute and peremptory, it was only a command of trial, to discover his faith and obedience; for though <hi>Abraham</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it as an absolute command, yet the event shewed it was only conditional, and for trial. But secondly, Grant that God had peremptorily required this, so as that <hi>Abraham</hi> had obeyed it, yet herein God had willed no unjust or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous thing, because God hath an absolute, supream, and unlimited dominion over all mens lives, so that although one man is bound not to kill another, yet God may take away any mans life, when and how he pleaseth: God may annihilate all men, seeing he only created them, and gives them all the being they have. So that if God might have destroyed or killed <hi>Isaac</hi> immediatly by his own hand, he might also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Abraham</hi> to be an instrument thereunto. Hence also it is, that God might without injustice or wrong have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded men to have been sacrificed to him as beasts were, as we see the Heathens did their, thereby acknowledging Gods supream dominion: but he being full of mercy and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion appointed the sacrifice of beasts in mans stead, which was witnessed by the sacrificers laying his hand upon the sacrifice. Its true God by reason of his justice cannot destroy or afflict his creature by way of punishment, unless it be for sinne, for they two are necessarily conjoyned; but simply to kill or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy from his dominion and supream power, he may without any shadow of wrong; yea such is Gods infiniteness, and we are so totally depending on him in all things, that he cannot do us any injury at all.</p>
                  <p>And as for the second instance, we must confess that it did much perplex <hi>Austin</hi> of old, to answer <hi>Faustus</hi> the Manichee, who held, that the God of the Old Testament was not the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118921:26"/> same with the God of the New, and they bring this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, where God is said to command the people both to lie and steal from the Egyptians: but we shall answer to the first thing, that which seems to be stealing and robbing; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the manner, that which seemeth to be lying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding. For the former, it was not theft or robbery in the Israelites to take the Egyptians goods; for God (as you heard) who is the Lord of all things, he may take the goods that one man injoyeth and give them to another, and this he doth when men have wickedly abused them to his dishonour. Now the Egyptians had abused their gold and silver to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, they had oppressed the Israelites and not paid them for their work and service; God therefore whose is the earth and the fulness thereof, he bestoweth those goods upon the Israelites: Even as he took the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were the lawfull possessors thereof, for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and wickedness, and gave it to the Israelites. Thus we are in these instances to have an eye upon Gods dominion, and although he hath given such good things to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth, yet he hath not alienated his dominion, or propriety, but he is Lord still, and therefore when any abuses the mercies he betrusteth them with, he takes them away and giveth them to others. But you must know that though God doth thus, yet men may not upon presumption that other men are wicked and unworthy adventure to do so, being bound by the Law of a Superiour, but God is not so tied; And by this we may answer that question, Whether God can dispense with the Law and duties of nature, or the morality of any of the ten Commandments, to give a man leave not to love him, or to lye and steal? For seeing God is thus holy and righteous, he cannot approve of, or command any thing that is intrinsecally a sinne, or dispence with any duty that is intrinsecally good, for the Decalogue in the moral part of it, is of eternal, immutable and perpetual verity. As the fire burneth in every Country alike, so what is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally just and righteous, is every where so. Even <hi>Tully, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de rep.</hi> could say, that the Law of nature was such a Law, <hi>Nec prorogari fas est, nec derogarie hac aliquid licet, nec tota abrogari
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118921:27"/> potest, non per Senatum</hi> or <hi>per populum</hi> can we be freed from this Law: yea God himself, because his holy Will is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law to himself, cannot free the creature from it. Indeed some Schoolmen have said, No action is intrinsecally evil, but becomes so, because God forbids it, and therefore say that usual position, Some things are evil because prohibited, Some things are prohibited because evil, is true only with man, not with God, with whom they say nothing is evil, unless because of his prohibition. Hence is that detestable position of <hi>Mayso, lib. sent. dist.</hi> 17. <hi>quae.</hi> 2. That God might have made a Law, that whosoever shall blaspheme him should be blessed in heaven, and whosoever should praise him should be thrown into hell. But the bitter root of such opinions is, because they hold nothing is intrinsecally evil or good. Its true if we speak of actions in their physical entity, so there is no evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal to them; but take them as moral actions, so to hate God, to lie or steal can never be but sinnes. The Israelites action therefore in taking the Egyptians goods, was not theft, not that God dispensed with his Law, but altered the object and propriety; so that by the true Master of all, that which was the Egyptians is now become the true possession of the Israelites. And further, Theft is the taking of another mans goods against his will, but God did so bow the Egyptians hearts, that they willingly gave them their goods. Hence <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.36. where it is translated <hi>the Egyptians lent them,</hi> according to the Hebrew it is, <hi>They even made and provoked the Israelites to ask of them,</hi> they were so willing to help them. And as for the later doubt, which the Manichees objected, God by <hi>Moses</hi> taught them to lye and defraud, for they borrowed these goods of the Egyptians, intending to spoil them thereby. Its true <hi>Austin</hi> could not well resolve it, but said, Though we cannot tell how they did well, yet we are to believe it. But though we translate the word <hi>borrowing,</hi> yet the Hebrew word is for to <hi>ask</hi> and <hi>require,</hi> therefore we cannot from the text prove any more then that they did crave and ask those goods of the Egyptians, and although there was no reason why they should grant them such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, the Egyptians having been such oppressing enemies
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118921:27"/> alwaies of them; yet here appeared Gods wonderfull power, that he could so suddenly turn their hearts and make them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to them. <hi>Bonfrecius</hi> the Jesuite <hi>in loc.</hi> saith, they might lawfully borrow those Jewels of the Egyptians, and yet be not guilty of any fraud, though they paid them not again, because there was such a condition implied, Unless these goods prove to be our own, and thus it was with them. But though the Israelites in borrowing did not reveal all the truth, yet they denied none; and its not necessary in every case to reveal all the truth, though it be alwaies necessary to deny none.</p>
                  <p>The third instance is from <hi>Hosea</hi> 1.3. Gods command to <hi>Hosea,</hi> that he should <hi>take a woman of whoredoms to wife.</hi> This instance hath also much tortured the thoughts of most Learned men; yea great parties have been made about it. There are three several waies of Interpretation, all which have Learned abettors, but which way soever it fall, there will not appear any thing as if God did love or command un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness. <hi>Ribera</hi> the Jesuite holds that the Prophet did really take a notorious whore to wife, though by her marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the Prophet she became holy, and so the scandal was taken away, and for this he alleadgeth many Authors; but this seemeth not probable, and therefore <hi>Tarnovius</hi> doth by many solid reasons confute this, <hi>Exercitat. Bibl.</hi> 605. In the second place <hi>Tarnovius</hi> following <hi>Luther,</hi> saith, The Prophet took a godly sober woman to wife, but put those infamous names upon her and her children, thereby to admonish the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> that they were guilty of such whoredoms. The third is of <hi>Rivet</hi> and others, who make this not to be really done by the Prophet, no not so much as in vision, but understood it as a Parable, Go thou and prophesie to the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> who have indeed been married to the Lord, but they have proved full of whoredoms: and they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Prophets wife, because he was now in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by his prophesie to take care of them. This is thought to be the most genuine interpretation, and accompanied with least inconveniencies, for though it depart from the letter of the text, yet that is lawfull, when in the letter there is any
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118921:28"/> indecent or dishonest thing commanded, as <hi>Austin</hi> of old observed. But as for our purpose, in none of these is any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous thing commanded, no not in the first Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because they say, this woman, though formerly an whore, yet by the Prophets marriage of her was reduced to a sober and chast life: And thus much for the direction of your understandings in those famous instances.</p>

In heaven, there the righteous is compassed about with all blessedness, because he is inwardly perfected with all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, as in the upper region there are no disturbing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors: But we are not in this life so high, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subject to many unrighteous, unholy thoughts and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, its no wonder that we have the rod sometimes on our backs.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. There are many particular exercises of righteousness, as its taken for the universal rectitude of the whole man, which cannot be demonstrated but under afflictions and calamities. Now God will have us put forth every kinde of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Were there not afflictions we could not discover our patience and humility, no nor such love to God, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him; afflictions being like the winde that bloweth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the flower, which makes it smell the sweeter, and like the pounding of Frankincense, that is the more fragrant.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:118921:28"/>3. God though he afflict the righteous, yet cannot be said <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the less to love them, yea he loveth them the more; and did he not love them, he would not chasten them, for <hi>whom God loveth he chastens,</hi> Rom. 3. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>Without this we are bastards and no children.</hi> Now the love of God in afflicting his own children, is discovered, In the original of afflictions, In the final cause of them, and In the effects thereof.</p>
                  <p>In the Original, for they come from Gods tender love; though he be angry, yet its an anger of love, and therefore whom God hateth he will not punish; yea he delivers them up to their lusts without any affliction to hinder them, so that thou maiest from those very afflictions say, Now I know the Lord loveth me, that he will not let me runne with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the waies of sinne; as <hi>David</hi> confessed it was Gods faithfulness to afflict him, for till then he went astray, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.75.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is love in the Final cause, God therefore chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the righteous, that sinne may be bitter, that the light of his countenance may be more to them then all the world; that they may be weary of this <hi>Egypt,</hi> and long for <hi>Canaan;</hi> Were not these thorns put under us sometimes, we should lie down too sweetly and securely in the bosom of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so that some afflictions are as necessary as thy food and raiment to thee: This rod of correction beats out the folly in thy heart, this filing of thee takes off thy rust.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is love in the Effects thereof, for being sanctified by God, they purge from sinne, they consume the dross, they winnow away the chaff, and are the happy physick which God the wise Physitian administers to the soul; so that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, as the Apostle saith, <hi>No affliction is for the present joyous, but grievous,</hi> Heb. 12.11. yet the effect thereof is peace and righteousness. There is not any affliction God hath brought on thee, but thou wilt say in the end thereof, that God loved thee, therefore he did so to thee, yea thou wilt bless God, as <hi>David</hi> did, for those chastisements; Who was I that the Lord did take such notice of me, that he hedged in my way with thorns? Oh I had been undone, if I had found the way to sin broad and open!</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:118921:29"/>
                  <p>Lastly, These afflictions are of love, if you consider the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and serviceableness of them to assure and evidence unto us the truth of our grace, for when we shall continue in the way of righteousness, when there is no earthly incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, yea when there are all outward disheartnings, This is a sign we love righteousness for righteousness sake: as <hi>Jacobs</hi> love was manifested to be unfained, when he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all that hardship for <hi>Rachel. Job</hi> discovered the sincerity of his heart, when he would trust in God and depend on him, even then when God seemed to be most against him: He did to God, that which <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he loved them, though they loved him the less. When righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and prosperity go together, thou canst not tell to which thy heart doth most adhere: as a servant behind two great Lords, you cannot tell to which he belongs till you see them part: Thus when righteousness and outward advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges go together, you cannot well tell which you love best; but when it cometh to this, that thou must part with righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness or worldly profits, and thou wilt readily leave the later, to enjoy the former, this declareth the soundness of thy graces: That thou art like the sea, which though never so much water rain upon it, yet that keeps its natural tast and saltness. Thus though afflictions one after another come upon thee, yet thou doest not repent of thy righteousness, but art resolved to live holily, though for its sake thou loosest goods, honours, and life it self.</p>

                     </label> and requireth a large Tractate, it hath exercised both the Ancient and later Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Church of God: But so farre as it may relate to our matter in hand, I shall answer in some particulars; and the rather because <hi>Lorinus</hi> the Jesuite from this text, <hi>God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth righteousness,</hi> doth charge the Protestants as making God the author of sinne, and so to love sinne as well as righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. To clear this, consider first, That in the doctrine of Gods will about sinne, some speak in the defect, and some run into a blasphemous excess. The Papists would conclude all that God wils or doth about sinne, under a meer bare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, though in the explication some use more rigid and hard expressions then the Protestants do. But certainly those Scripture expressions before mentioned, signifie more then a bare permission. In the excess run those blasphemous Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, against whom <hi>Calvin</hi> wrote, that made God the author of all the sins they committed, saying it was not they that did thus and thus, but God in them, as some a late have written blasphemously to that purpose. But the truth lieth between these, it goeth not to the right hand or left: for its certain the Scripture attributeth such actions as are sins to God, even as it doth at other times hands and eyes; so that all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is, how we must understand these and not blaspheme the holy Nature of God. Learned men alledge a speech of <hi>Hugo,</hi> Godly souls are started when they hear God wils sin, <hi>viz.</hi> to be, and they abhor it, <hi>Non quia non bene dicitur, sed quia non bene intelligitur.</hi> In the first place therefore, let this be laid down as a firm Conclusion, That <hi>God cannot properly and positively will sinne in others, or sinne himself, or tempt, and incourage, or incite others to sin, neither can he be the author of sin.</hi> The Sun may suffer an eclipse and lose the manifestation of light, but <hi>James</hi> 1. with God there is no shadow of change. The Word of God speaks wholly to this purpose, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. <hi>Thou art not a God that willest iniquity:</hi> The Hebrew word signifieth to take pleasure and delight in it: yea <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. his eyes are so pure they cannot indure to behold it. Thus whatsoever an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or wrath you reade God hath, its only against sin; for this
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118921:30"/> all his jugdements are, for this he hath appointed those eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal flames of hell; so that though the damned creature lieth roaring to all eternity, yet he cannot get a day of ease; how then can God be said to Love or Will that which he only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth, and hath decreed to punish with such unspeakable torments? <hi>James</hi> 1.23. doth directly speak to this, <hi>God is not tempted, nor can be tempt others, but every one is seduced by his own lusts:</hi> And indeed there are strong reasons for this: First, Because of the perfect and infinite Knowledge in God, whereby he knoweth evil in all the abhorrency and vileness of it; so that if God should sinne (pardon the supposition) it would be against the greatest light that ever was, which is the highest aggravation of a sin, as we see in the Apostate Angels; but Gods Knowledge is so perfect, that no evil can insinuate into him. 2. Gods holy Nature and Will is the rule and measure of all righteousness; so that if it were possible for God to Will a sin, it would by his willing of it cease to be sin, it would thereby be made good; so that we may better say, there can be no such thing as sin, then that God can Will it. 3. Sin hath no proper efficient but a deficient cause; now the perfection of God is so Infinite and Absolute, that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any defect conceived in him: Therefore not only in the Church of God, but even amongst the wisest Heathens, this hath been an ingrafted principle, that God could not Will sin. Therefore take heed of charging thy sins upon God, thou canst not help it, God giveth not thee the grace he doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This we are prone to, as appeareth by <hi>Adam</hi> at first, <hi>The woman thou gavest me, bid me eat:</hi> So by the Apostles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, <hi>James</hi> 1. <hi>Let no man say God tempted him,</hi> for how canst thou charge God thus foolishly, when he hath implanted a conscience to accuse and arraign thee upon the commission of sin? Though none know of it, yet thou fearest and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest; which made <hi>Seneca</hi> say, <hi>Maxima peccantium paena est, peccasse,</hi> and <hi>sceleris in scelere supplicium est.</hi> Whence come those fears and horrors, if God did not hate sin?</p>

                  <p>That we may therefore avoid all rocks, let us consider first how farre,<note place="margin">Wherein Gods will is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant about sin, and wherein it is not.</note> or wherein Gods will is conversant about sin, and wherein it is not. And</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>This is agreed upon by all, that God hath a permissive will about sinne.</hi> He doth not simply and absolutely will it, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> nor yet peremptorily nill it, for then it could not be, but he wils the suffering of it. This permissive will of God is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious will in some sense; for it is not as when a man saith to another, Do what you will, I will have no hand in it one way or other, but its truly and really a will, not of the sinne but of the permission of sinne, only the Orthodox call it a permissive will, in opposition to that approving and efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will God hath in good things, for the good things that are, God doth both <hi>facere</hi> and <hi>ordinare,</hi> make and order; but evil things he doth not make, onely he orders them. The word then is used to shew a difference between Gods will in good things and in evil; so that its a wretched calumny of the Papists, as if the Orthodox did hold, That <hi>Judas</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of Christ, was as much willed by God, as <hi>Peters confession</hi> of him. We grant, that God hath a permissive will, as <hi>Genes.</hi> 20. God told <hi>Abimelech, He had not suffered him to commit sinne;</hi> only we say, Permission is not all God doth, and the Scripture expressions of Gods work about sin, signifie more then that; only when we say, God permits sin to be, we must not take permission in such a sense, as when Christ said, <hi>Moses suffered the Israelites to give a bill of Divorce for the hardnesse of their heart;</hi> for according to some mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that permission made such repudiating to be no sin: nor is it in such sense, as when its disputed, whether a Magistrate may suffer stew-houses or hereticks; for in that sense, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission doth not signifie an acquittance from sinne, yet an immunity from punishment; but God never permits sinne in any such sense: only by permission we mean Gods will not to impede or hinder a man from sinning, when if he please he can do it immediately. Therefore <hi>Gibieuf</hi> expresseth it well, That God doth not <hi>permittere potestati,</hi> but <hi>potentiae, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de liber.</hi> he doth not permit it, that any one shall have right or priviledge, and impunity to sinne; but to the powers or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118921:31"/> faculties of the soul, by not restraining them. This permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive will of God must needs be acknowledged; for who can say, sinne comes into the world absolutely against Gods will, he would have hindered it, but could not; this is to make Gods will not omnipotent, and mans will stronger then his.</p>
                  <p>Hence in the second place, <hi>Let us say no more in Gods will about sinne, then the Scripture, and plain reason will compell men, yet we shall never be able to satisfie cavilling spirits.</hi> For grant but this bare permissive will; will not the prophane man cavil and say, Why doth God suffer me to runne head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into sinne? Why doth he see me tumbling and falling, and doth not reach out his hand? If a man should see a blind man running head-long upon deep pits and precepies, it would be a sinne in a man not to stop that blinde man; yet God seeth blinde, infirm, miserable man falling into sinne, but doth not stay him. Thus prophane men would cavill, and all, because <hi>they would have God obliged and tied by such Laws, as man is:</hi> Yea, if we do grant a fore-knowledge in God barely about sinne, that he fore-knew when he created <hi>Adam,</hi> that he would sinne and undo all his posterity, at this the froward heart of man will cavill, as well as at any thing else. This is good to be observed, because of some men who affect new opinions, thinking thereby to stop every froward spirit in this point; for that's impossible; for seeing God doth permit sinne, <hi>Sciens &amp; volens,</hi> and if man should do this, it would be blame-worthy in him, we must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that God is not bound by such Laws, as man his creature is.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gods will, yea and his working or causality goeth to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the material of every sinne.</hi> He produceth every act to which sinne is annexed, though not the sinne, <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being;</hi> the tongue of the blasphemer, the hand of the thief could not move to sinne, did not God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereunto; only as man doth it, he sinneth, because he is deficient from that rule, whereby he ought to walk, but God who is perfection it self cannot deviate from his eternal Law of holinesse within himself. This indeed hath greatly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118921:32"/> exercised some, how God can produce the act of sinne to which deformity is annexed, and yet not be the author of sinne; and the rather, because sinne being either a <hi>privation</hi> or else as others a <hi>positive relation</hi> at most, it cannot be brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> about any other way then by causing the <hi>fundamentum</hi> which is the <hi>material act</hi> to which sinne adhereth; As the withdrawing of light doth thereby produce darknesse, and darknesse cannot otherwise come to be, there cannot be any positive efficiency of it: Neither will it avail to say, God wils not sinne <hi>quà</hi> sin, in this action, for so neither doth man, it being not possible that a man intending evil, should thereby work it, for evil <hi>quà</hi> evil is not the object of the will, no more then <hi>falsum quà falsum</hi> can be of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; how then to clear God, and yet make man culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is the great work to be done; and those emphatical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the Scripture about Gods will concerning sinne made those <hi>Libertines Calvin</hi> wrote against <hi>Opusc. ad liber.</hi> attribute not only the <hi>actions,</hi> but the <hi>ataxy</hi> and inordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof to God, whereby they could not endure that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> should be said, Such a man murdered or committed adultery: They said it was blasphemy to say so, because it was Gods work not mans. Thus, saith <hi>Calvin,</hi> they transformed God into the devil, and made him equal, if not worse, then him. But as the Cloud was light to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and darknesse to the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> so the Scripture is a Rule of light and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to godly, sober mindes, but a cause of stumbling and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to carnal, vain hearts. But you may say, How can it be that the same action proceeding from God, and from man, that it should be a sinne as it cometh from man, and not from God? Some to avoid this, as <hi>Durand</hi> of old, and <hi>Dodo</hi> of late, have maintained, that God hath no immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course or efficiency in our actions: God, say they, created man with a power and ability to do such and such actions, he giveth him onely the power, and man acteth afterwards wholly of himself. But the Scripture speaketh otherwayes, <hi>In him we live and move;</hi> and if this were so, then God could not represse the action of a creature without destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power; but we reade, God hindered the fire
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118921:32"/> from burning; and yet it remained fire having a power to burn.</p>
                  <p>Others, they say, Therefore God is not the cause of the sinne, though of the action, because he cooperateth only in the way of a <hi>physical</hi> or natural cause, not <hi>moral,</hi> by approving, counselling or allaying of it, as <hi>Canus</hi> and <hi>Vasquez:</hi> but that is not satisfactory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and so most of the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> they say, God is freed, because he concurreth onely as an universal cause, he offereth his aid, as that which is indifferent, and so by man is used to a good or bad action. But certainly this cannot clear God; for how unworthy is it to conceive of God thus? As if he should say to man, Here I give you assistance, use it as you please, either to a good or an evil action. <hi>Bradwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> solidly confuted this Assertion of old, <hi>De causa Dei lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 29. <hi>Constanter &amp; liberâ voce dico, illum nolo pro Deo habere, &amp;c.</hi> I cannot hold him for a God, whose most blessed will, I a most wicked sinner can <hi>velut mulirculam debilem oppri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere &amp; necessitare ad horribilem actum peccati</hi> necessitate to sin. This is to make God (saith he) <hi>Servituti peccatoris miserabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter subjectum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, If Gods concourse be thus indifferent to a good or bad action, then that which they slander the Protestants with, may truly be retorted on them, That God worked no more for <hi>Peters</hi> confession of him, then he did for <hi>Judas</hi> his betraying of him. The good is no more of him, then the evil.</p>
                  <p>Therfore <hi>Bradwardine</hi> he grants, That seeing God doth will the act, to which sinne is annexed necessarily, he doth also will the sinne, yet sinne is not imputed to God, because he doth not <hi>absolutely</hi> will it, but <hi>secundum quid:</hi> Yea, he saith, that in respect of God, who is the universal cause, there is no sinne, that sinne is so called onely in respect of a particular cause, for to God both <hi>mala</hi> and <hi>bona</hi> are <hi>bona,</hi> seeing he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all sinne to good, yea to a greater good, then sinne can be evil. Thus <hi>Joseph</hi> told his brethren, <hi>You thought evil to me, but God turned it to good.</hi> But the most solid answer may be, That though God doth enable to that act, to which sinne
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118921:33"/> adhereth, yet God doth neither sinne, nor cause man to sin, because what God doth, he doth most perfectly, nor is tied to hinder sinne; but man works in a defective manner, not according to the Rule; so that sinne is immediately from the instrument man, or the devil, which God useth, not from God; as the Sunne-beams shining upon a noisome carcasse, the ill smell is not to be attributed to the Sunne, but to the dung-hill.</p>
                  <p>Others say, As a man that driveth a lame horse, he is the cause of the horses motion, but the lamenesse is from the horse; or as a man that writeth, the motion of the pen is from the hand, but the blotting and blurring is from some unfitnesse in the pen. Or lastly, as the Musician is the cause of the Tune upon the instruments string, but that there is any harshnesse or jarring, is from the instrument it self: So then conclude of this truth as most certain, that all those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or motions to which sinne cleaveth, as they have a physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal entity, or natural being, must needs be from God, the chief and first being; as every stream must needs come from the fountain; hence is that Rule, <hi>Omne malum fundatur in bono,</hi> there cannot be a pure and meer evil, but it must adhere to some natural good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>As God doth thus concurre to the act of sin; so also he doth will sinne as a punishment.</hi> Thus in those places fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, where God is said to <hi>harden,</hi> or <hi>to give up to lusts,</hi> it is to be understood as these sins are punishments. Nor can this be any love to sinne, but a terrible demonstration of his wrath against it. Some have denied that one sinne can be a punishment of another, but the Scripture is very clear in this, he is not the cause of the evil in the punishment, but of the punishment in the evil: for although sin as it is sin is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary to the sinner, and so he findes a delight in it: Yet as by this he is left by God to run more obstinately in wayes of sin, and be thereby at last deprived of all happinesse; so it is a misery and a punishment. Indeed God did not will the first sin by way of punishment, but as <hi>Augustine</hi> observeth all sins since the first, are both sins, causes of sin, and punishments of sin: Although as <hi>Pererius</hi> well observeth, Those efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118921:33"/> words the Scripture useth are not applied to every sinne or sinner, but to such as are notorious and in a more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner left by God, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> for abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing such mercies. Its no wonder then if God be said to will sin as a punishment, for that is good, and an act of justice, yea it would be absurd to say, God onely suffers or permits that, for in this God doth demonstrate his holy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, and hereby evil is made good; and as <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith, <hi>Inordinationem, non inordinatum relinquit.</hi> Neither may we say, How can sin being a privation come from God the Judge? for we see even in humane judicatories, when the punishment is <hi>privative,</hi> as the losse of honour or goods, yet the judgement about it is positive.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>God may be said to will sinne not as sinne, but as its a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> means to declare his justice or mercy.</hi> Although sin be not in it self <hi>medium perse,</hi> of any good, no more then venome or poison is of health, yet by the wisdome of God, its made conducible to those wise and holy ends which he intends, and in this sense its true, then even <hi>mala</hi> are <hi>bona,</hi> in respect of Gods ordering of them for a greater good, then evil suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed can be evil; and howsoever the Papists calumniate this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, yet <hi>Gibieuf</hi> expresly asserts it, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de liber.</hi> Evil (saith he) may be so either <hi>per modum objecti,</hi> as if it were an object to be desired or approved of, or else <hi>per modum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii,</hi> as it may be used by God for advancing his glory, and so God doth will it. Neither doth God herein offend against that Rule, <hi>We may not do evil that good may come of it,</hi> for God doth not do evil, his permitting of evil to be, is good, though the evil be not good.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Gods work and will about sin is seen in the denying of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that grace which if the sinner had he would not offend.</hi> And thus God may be said to cause sinne, as <hi>removens prohibens;</hi> As he that withdraweth a pillar or foundation of a house, may be said to pull down the house: Gods denying of grace is either meerly <hi>negative,</hi> when he doth not at first offer or vouchsafe it to man. Thus the Heathens live without the knowledge or offer of saving grace: Or secondly, <hi>Privative,</hi> when he doth withdraw such grace, either in whole or in part, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118921:34"/> on some men: Thus many unregenerate men, though they had not true sanctifying grace, yet they had many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings and mollifyings of Gods Spirit, which they neglecting and contemning, God in a just judgement denieth them any such workings any more. Thus God is said <hi>to make the eyes of the Israelites blinde, and their ears deaf, and their hearts hard,</hi> not by infusing any wickednesse into them, but by denying such softning or preparatory works that they have upon them. Thus the Sun may be said to harden by withdrawing its beams, and he may be said to kill a man that takes away the food and sustenance he should live on. A terrible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is, and the portion only of such who live within the means of grace, and abuse them; men are sensible of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon their bodies, their estates, but not upon their souls: How doth a man complain that hath lost his eyes, it makes him weary of his life? Yet how many hundreds are there that are deprived of the spiritual eye, and yet lay it not to heart? neither stand with the blinde man, where Christ is to come in his Ordinances, praying, <hi>Lord, that we may receive our sight!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, <hi>Gods will and work in sin is seen by delivering up to Satan, letting him have power and dominion to do what he will.</hi> Thus into the false prophets God sent lying spirits, and <hi>Judas</hi> had the devil entring into his heart, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.27. Oh there are many prophane, cursing wretches that have nothing more in their mouths then this! The devil take them, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth too true. The devil hath taken thy soul, the better part of thee already. Its he that keepeth all at peace within thee, though a childe of the devil, though in gall and wormwood, yet thou playest, riotest and runnest into all excess; whence is this obstinateness and wilfulness, but because the devil is in thy heart. As the godly are filled with the holy Ghost, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they boldly speak the things of God in the midst of all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; so wicked men being filled with the devil, can drink, swear, be prophane, and contemn all the thoughts of hell and damnation. As we see in the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> they ventured to go into the sea, when it was made dry for the <hi>Israelites,</hi> they feared not but boldly go on, and then on a sudden the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118921:34"/> waters overwhelm them. Thus do wicked men, they boldly and desperately venture upon such and such a sin, which when committed, at last Gods anger ariseth to their utter perdition. Oh then be afraid lest thy sins be so great that God deliver thee up to the devil! And as the bodily possessed, were thrown sometimes into the water, and sometimes into the fire; so thou fallest, sometimes in one grievous sin, and sometimes in another; when God leaveth thee thus to sin and Satan, he doth, saith <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> as if a great Captain should forsake his Army in the midst of their cruel enemies upon which ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine followeth inevitably.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Gods will and work about sin is in removing all those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> externals that might curb sin, he will not chasten or afflict them,</hi> as <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.14. so <hi>Ephraim is joyned to idols, let him alone;</hi> or else he removeth the Word and faithful Ministers, and when they are thus in the dark, they must needs fall: or if God do continue such mercies, as he did wonderful things to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> it is to harden them more. These mercies fat them to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: These Sun-beams do the more blinde them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is one way that <hi>Austin</hi> acknowledged God hardens by his patience: three wayes he may do it, 1. <hi>Per Permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionem.</hi> 2. <hi>Patientiam,</hi> 3. <hi>Potentiam.</hi> Thus whatsoever befals the wicked man it becomes a snare to him, it furthers his sin and damnation.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, you may ask,<note place="margin">Why God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers sin to be.</note> Why doth God suffer sin thus to be? And here as <hi>Gibieuf lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de liber.</hi> observeth, we may better ask for a reason of the sin suffered, then of Gods will suffering it, for that is to ask a cause of Gods will, which cannot be, for then there were a greater thing then that, but in common speech we say, God doth will sin to be for these ends,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That thereby Christ may be exalted and magnified;</hi> Out of sinne God works the greatest good, even Christ our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, which made <hi>Gregory</hi> say, <hi>Foelix culpa, quae talem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruit habere redemptorem,</hi> if sin had not been, Christ had not been.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>God by the permission of sin exalts his attributes,</hi> of justice in punishing, of mercy and grace in forgiving, and of wisdom
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118921:35"/> in ordering of it; let us not then prophanely cavil at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sin, but heartily admire all the glorious attributes of God exalted thereby, as sin hath abounded, so Gods grace and mercy hath abounded.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>God makes sin turn to the very good of him that committed it,</hi> because <hi>Paul</hi> was a blasphemer and a persecutor, the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sinner of all, therefore he was more humble then all. This made <hi>Austin</hi> say, <hi>Audeo dicere, quod utile est superbis in aliquod manifestum peccatum incidere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>By sin committed, the graces of the godly are more orient and glorious.</hi> Contraries do illustrate one another. As in speech there is a figure called <hi>Antithesis,</hi> whereby the oration is more glorious, so there is, saith <hi>Austin,</hi> an <hi>eloquentia rerum,</hi> by evil good is more praised. Thus the dark night sets out the day, the dark shadows in the picture adorn it, and the pauses or silence in singing make the melody sweeter.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Many excellent graces in the godly could never have been demonstrated, had not God suffered wicked men to satisfie their will.</hi> The patience, zeal and fortitude of <hi>Martyrs</hi> were seen by the wickedness of <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Dioclesian</hi> persecutors. As the <hi>Gardner</hi> (saith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) sets his garlick and unsavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry herbs near his violets and roses, that so their sweet smell may be the more diffused; thus God makes the goodnesse of the godly admirable by the wickednesse of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse of Admonition,</hi> to adore that wisdome and power of God, who can and doth turn all the wickednesse in the world to such wonderful good; so that the godly may say, their sins, yea and the sins of the Churches enemies have been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py sins. If a man come into the Artificers shop, he admireth at all the crooked and toothed instruments that are, to what use they be: but the Artificer makes curious and polished ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials by such instruments; even thus God doth with all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom <hi>vers.</hi> 25. to the end of this <hi>vers.</hi> 26. we have a Divine and Theological description of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so that both the matter described, and the manner of the description are admirable. As there is the Song of Songs, and was the Holy of Holies, so this part
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118921:36"/> of Scripture may be called <hi>Evangelium Evangelii,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of the Gospel, it being the summe and breviary of it. This noble and divine priviledge of Justification is described in all the causes of it, the <hi>efficient,</hi> which is the grace of God; the <hi>material</hi> or meritorious cause, Christ crucified; the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental</hi> cause, Faith; and which is observable, not only <hi>Cajetan,</hi> but <hi>Lapide in locum,</hi> do acknowledge and call faith the <hi>causa applicans</hi> of our Justification. Lastly, There is the <hi>final cause,</hi> and that for the notableness of it is twice repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>vers.</hi> 25. and in my Text.

Therefore our Interpreters adde <hi>[I say]</hi> to declare [I say] as hereby intimating how worthy it is of our observation and notice again and again. Thus we have this Scripture, like the grain of mustard-seed, little in quantity, but it will grow up into a vast tree; so (that if we may allegorize) both the birds of the air may build their nests here, the sublime and most penetrating un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings may finde a subject imploying them to the full; and the beasts of the field, even prophane and wicked men, but sensible and weary of their sinnes, may come and finde a shadow of refreshment from this Text. So truly might <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin in loc.</hi> say, <hi>Non est insignior locus,</hi> there is not a more sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and eminent place in all the Scripture for describing the nature of our Justification, then this: And if the true doctrine of Justification be <hi>the Pillar of the Church,</hi> this is the Pillar of that Pillar.

                     </gap>, righteousness here; for in the Scripture, especially in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, the Righteousness of God is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken two waies, either for the <hi>attribute</hi> whereby he is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or else for that righteousness whereby we are justified, which the Apostle often cals <hi>the Righteousness of God,</hi> either because its of Gods procuring, or of his imputing, or because acceptable to him; of which more in its time.

                     </gap>, which is not a remission, but a transmissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the punishment of sinne: God did not exact in the old Testament the price or satisfaction for our sinnes, but deferred it till the times of the Gospel: Not but that the Fathers then had pardon of sinne, and God did by many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible temporal judgements punish the wicked, but the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory service was not performed till Christ came, though the benefit of it did extend to times past, because Christs death did work as a meritorious and so a moral cause; now for a moral cause to work its not necessary it should exist imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, its enough if it have <hi>esse cognitum,</hi> as the Schools say, that there be a minde which knoweth it and looks to it, as God did. Gods time then in the old Testament was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118921:37"/> or putting off the punishment of sinne, called therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> observeth well (though <hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi> saith its false, whereas he is deceived, following the Vulgar translation) that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> patience is never attributed to God, because God cannot be said to suffer: but either <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or here in the Text <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. This is the first reason. Secondly, By Righteousness we must understand the justice of God, because Christ is here said to be a <hi>propitiation, and that through his blood;</hi> so that although the grace of God be discovered in our Justification, so also is Gods justice, for therefore Christ shed his blood to appease the wrath of God; and he is called here the <hi>propitiation,</hi> in allusion to the Mercy-seat made of pure gold, wherein God doth graciously reveal his will as reconciled, called therefore a <hi>placator</hi> or <hi>reconciler.</hi> This is a cogent reason, and thus <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Pareus</hi> take righteousness; and in this sense righteousness is often used, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. The last day of judgement is said to be in <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5, 7. Indeed learned <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> noteth upon <hi>ver.</hi> 21. that the righteousness of God is used alwaies for his goodness, mercy and salvation, and that it is never used to signifie that which we call justice, whereby God punisheth sinne. But <hi>Lodov. de Deiu</hi> upon this Text, doth solidly confute that assertion, shewing that although sometimes it may signifie the mercy of God, yet often, and most properly its attributed to God, as the just Judge of the world; and he instanceth in some places above mentioned, adding also, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.16. and so saith he it must be understood in this Text, for God sheweth his privative and vindicative justice, when by Christs blood, Satan hell and death, all the enemies of Gods children are overcome; and this, saith he, is evidenced, because the Apostle mentioneth a <hi>propitiation</hi> and redemption through Christs blood, and this the Jews acknowledged by their sacrifices, who thought thereby they obtained mercy after justice was satisfied.</p>
                  <p>One thing more is to be added, that the Apostle useth three words of some affinity with one another: The first is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that is once only, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. translated Justification. The second is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and that sometimes is taken for the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118921:37"/> Laws and Commandments of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.6. sometimes for the constitution and appointment of God to punish, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. and sometimes for Justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.16. in a clean other sense then <hi>Aristotle</hi> useth it, who distinguisheth <hi>Ethic. lib.</hi> 5. from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and makes it to be the correcting and punishing of that which is unjust. The third word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> here in the Text, and often in other places, applied sometimes to things, and sometimes to persons or actions, sometimes to God, and sometimes to man; whereas then we see Christ set forth to be <hi>a propitiation for sinne,</hi> for this end, <hi>that God might declare his justice and righteousness, his severity and anger against sinne,</hi> Observe,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Christ crucified is a demonstration of Gods justice and anger against sinne.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Observ.</note> You may not look only for full demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of Gods grace and love, but also of his justice and anger. <hi>Justified by his grace,</hi> there is mercy; <hi>through the blood of Christ,</hi> there is justice. Now the limitation of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of Gods justice in the Text, <hi>viz. to this time,</hi> the time of the Gospel, is very observable; for we are apt to think the time of the Gospel only a time of demonstration of Gods grace; that God never revealed so much love as in these daies: and indeed this is true, therefore its called <hi>the acceptable time, the time of salvation,</hi> the spiritual Jubilee: But yet withall its a time wherein God demonstrateth his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, that his hatred against sinne is so implacable, that only the blood of his dear Son can pacifie him. God manifested his anger against sinne in the destruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> as also in the drowning of the whole world; but Christ crucified on the cross may more evidence Gods fury and displeasure against sinne, then any of those judgements; yea the torments of damned persons in hell do not so visibly shew forth Gods irreconciliation with sinners, as Christs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of himself by way of an expiatory sacrifice for sinne. But that the truth of this doctrine may appear, its good to take notice of these Propositions.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That all mankinde through</hi> Adams <hi>transgression, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> wholly plunged in sinne, and thereby cursed by the Law, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to all the wrath of God threatned in his word.</hi> This the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118921:38"/> Apostle layeth as a sure foundation, to evince Gods grace and justice in our Justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>That every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God:</hi> This is a dreadfull doom that the Apostle passeth upon all: First, he applieth all those notorious transgressions which the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist reckoneth up, <hi>Their throat an open sepulchre, their feet swift to shed blood,</hi> &amp;c. to every one by nature; for though some only are actually so, yet seminally and habitually all are so; as young Serpents and Vipers are full of poyson, though they have not vented it. No man is born without this depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Then secondly, Hereby saith the Apostle mans <hi>mouth is stopped.</hi> The defect of his condemnation is so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, so clear to his own conscience, that he cannot plead any thing; not a word to say, his judgement is so palpably just. Thirdly, <hi>Every mans mouth is stopt,</hi> None can plead the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and goodness of his nature: no <hi>Jew,</hi> no <hi>Gentile,</hi> no <hi>Heathen,</hi> though never hearing of Christ, can open his mouth for justification; how blame-worthy then are those Authors, who will open their mouths for the salvation of such! But this is not enough, for fourthly, We are all hereby become <hi>guilty,</hi> or subject to Gods judgement; Every man is a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced wretch to condemnation, every day, and every hour, yea moment this may surprize. <hi>Paul</hi> said he died daily, but every natural man may fear being damned daily. And lastly observe the universality, <hi>All the world:</hi> There is not any one born in a natural way of <hi>Adam,</hi> that is exempted. All the world is thus at the mercy of God; They have sinned, Hell is ready, Tophet is prepared, and justice is lifting up the arm to give that eternal blow, only God staieth his hand: There wants nothing but a command from God, and then all the curse of the Law, and devils of hell lay hold upon thee as their own: This is every mans case: So also <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. every one is pronounced <hi>cursed, that continueth not in all things the Law requireth:</hi> Now no man doth that, but the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, breaketh every command, and that all the day long, his thoughts being alwaies and only upon evil; therefore we are all in this cursed estate: The ground is cursed, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are cursed, but none as man is cursed, whose condition
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118921:38"/> is worse then Toads or the vilest creatures that are; he had a thousand times better never to have been born, or to have been made a Serpent or Toad, then a Man, if never recovering from this natural state he is born in.</p>
                  <p>The second Proposition. <hi>As man is thus plunged into all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> sinne, so the anger and wrath of God is accordingly upon him.</hi> For though sinne may merit and justly deserve Gods wrath, yet some may think God will not take advantage, his mercy may be so great, that he will pass by all this relation: And thus indeed the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who deny <hi>Christs Satisfaction, and so lay the ax to the root of all Christianity.</hi> They say, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing mans sinne, yet God was never unreconciled with us, and that there is no such thing as justice in God, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily requireth such a satisfaction; yea, they make this doctrine of Christs Satisfaction to Gods justice, to be hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blasphemy: But what monstrous doctrines and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will not breed in mans heart, if not guided and assisted by God? for what is more clear in Scripture then Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous anger and judgements against wicked men? <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. <hi>Are we not all the children of Gods wrath?</hi> Is not God said to be <hi>angry with the wicked all the day long?</hi> Is not <hi>the wrath of God</hi> said <hi>to abide upon him that beleeveth not?</hi> So that such places do not only prove we are at enmity with God, but God also at enmity with us. Doth not the Scripture delight to call him <hi>a consuming fire?</hi> and that in respect of sinne? But (say the <hi>Socinians</hi>) God is said 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. to be <hi>reconciling the world to himself,</hi> and for that purpose the <hi>Gospel</hi> is the <hi>ministry of reconciliation;</hi> so that though we be enemies, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, yet God is to us, he was never unreconciled with mankinde; but they forget one passage in the Text, <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world;</hi> so that had it not been through Christ, the great gulf between God and man would have continued. Indeed God is said to be first the party though offended, to seek reconciliation, <hi>partly</hi> to demonstrate his love the more to us, though he need us not, though he is happy enough without us, though not he, but we have done the wrong, yet he offers reconciliation, and hereby man is made the more inexcusable; <hi>partly</hi> in allusion to the custom
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118921:39"/> amongst men,<note place="margin">Why God first seeks to man to be reconciled.</note> whom though the inferiour be bound to seek the face of his superiour whom he hath offended, yet he da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not be so bold the distance is so great. But <hi>lastly,</hi> the offer of reconciliation is attributed to God, because it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for man abiding in his sinfull condition, but to persist in all frowardness and rebellion against God. As <hi>David</hi> first sought out a way for reconciliation with <hi>Absolom;</hi> thus also God doth, because we, if left to our selves, should live and die in an obstinate aversness to him. Besides, The Text only saith, <hi>God is reconciling the world to himself;</hi> now there is a great difference between God <hi>reconciling</hi> and <hi>reconciled:</hi> The former supposeth in God a propensity to bring about the way of reconciliation; not that he is already reconciled, but this floweth from a general love and pity he beareth to mankinde, whereby he procureth a way that actual reconciliation may be obtained between man and God; yea <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.16. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. there is inferred a reconciliation of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile, Angels</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> together, who by sinne were made enemies; and all this is in <hi>uno tertio,</hi> to God himself, which supposeth that there was not only enmity between one another, but also against God himself: Let this then be firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded on, That <hi>God is an angry enemy and a professed adversary unto every man abiding in his natural condition, and that therefore it belongs to his justice not to bear or suffer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Majesty, but to be avenged on all, unless there be a way of satisfaction found out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Hence the third Proposition is, That <hi>Christ voluntarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came man, and offered up himself as a sacrifice upon the cross to satisfie Gods justice and expiate our sinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is that the <hi>Socinian ear cannot endure,</hi> though this be the Christian treasury;<note place="margin">The blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous errors of Socinians.</note> therefore they hold Christ to be but <hi>a meer man,</hi> though a constituted and gifted <hi>God</hi> after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; and because a meer man, they deny by his death he satisfied God, but that he died as a Martyr to confirm the doctrine he preached, and to be an example unto us to walk in all patience and self-denial; and whereas they complain that we use the word Satisfaction in a fundamental point of Religion, which yet is not in Scripture: We answer, The
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118921:39"/> thing is there, though not the word; there is <hi>redeeming,</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down a <hi>prize,</hi> becoming a <hi>sacrifice</hi> and <hi>propitiation,</hi> which is all one with <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> and they who will elude those words above mentioned, may they not, if the word <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> had been expresly mentioned evade also? would they not say, as they do about <hi>redemption</hi> and a <hi>sacrifice,</hi> that its only <hi>metaphorical?</hi> that the word is used sometimes when there is no <hi>price</hi> or <hi>expiation</hi> of the fault made, as in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Mark</hi> 15.15. But that Christ by his death did pacifie the wrath of God, and make an atonement to Gods justice, may easily be believed, if we do seriously consider with our selves, <hi>that it must be some weighty, urgent and important cause, that should make Christ to dye, and that so ignominiously.</hi> Its such a wonderfull mystery that it may make us stand asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, considering how dear Christ was to the Father, his <hi>only begotten Son, his well-beloved Son, who was in the bosom of the Father,</hi> yet God spareth not him, and that to <hi>become a curse for us, to dye a cursed death with all shame and ignominy.</hi> Who can think that all this should be to confirm doctrine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that Christ, did enough by his miracles and holy life? and besides all the blessed Martyrs that suffered for the truth, abundantly confirmed that: Shall we then think that God would put his only son to die in that unheard of manner, and for no more then the <hi>Socinian</hi> expresseth? Is here such infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love and unspeakable riches of grace only for this? Is he called a <hi>Saviour</hi> and a <hi>Mediator</hi> for no other end? Who that hath reason can be thus perswaded? But if this do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, the Scripture arguments are so powerfull, that they will compel us, and its wonder to see how the <hi>Socinians</hi> place and displace, pervert and subvert every phrase, every word, yea every comma, that they may not be forced to believe that which they are resolved against. And</p>

                     <hi>All those places of Scripture where Christ is said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, purchase, or buy us by his blood, do plainly demonstrate that a Satisfaction was given to God by Christs death.</hi> The words <label type="milestone">

                  <p>I Shall mention one or two more Arguments, to prove, <hi>That Christ died not only doctrinally, or exemplarily, but by way of atonement and expiation, so as to satisfie the justice of God, and appease his anger:</hi> For as <hi>David</hi> in an evil cause, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing possessed with rage, as soon as ever he heard <hi>Ʋriah</hi> was dead, began presently to be pacified: So the justice and anger of God being prepared to consume sinfull man, no sooner heareth of <hi>Christ crucified,</hi> but is accorded by an happy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament through Christ with mercy. Therefore that Christs death was expiatory is manifested further,</p>

                  <p>Among other places, there are these eminent Texts, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Chapter seemeth to be an History ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a Prophecy of Christs sufferings. As for <hi>Grotius</hi> his opinion, That the man here spoken of in the Text, was <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> primarily and literally, though he acknowledgeth more sublimely Christ to be understood, <hi>Annotat. in</hi> Isa. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.53. we passe it by as a Jewish fable, though all along his Annotations he mentioneth not Christ, but endeavoureth to shew how <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did bear the Jews sins, how he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for their transgression, and did bear their iniquities, <hi>viz.</hi> by his preaching and instruction: Even as the <hi>Socinians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it of Christ. But to the diligent Reader all things are as plain, as if he did with his bodily eyes see <hi>Christ crucified</hi> on the Crosse, sweating bloud in his grievous agonies; Let us consider the Prophet thus ocularly demonstrating Christ wounded, and that not for any sinne he had done, but for our iniquities; and whereas the Prophet informs us of the judgement most men had to see him thus extraordinarily smitten by God, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was some grand Impostor and Deceiver, At the 4<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
                     <hi>vers.</hi> he saith, <hi>Surely</hi> (that is a word of confidence, and of causality) <hi>he hath born our griefs, and carried our sorrows.</hi> By griefs and sorrows are principally meant our sins, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25. Though <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.15. seemeth to apply it to bodily diseases, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> greedily catch at, saying, As Christ took away bodily diseases, not because he did bear them on his own body, he had no palsie, no lamenesse or blindenesse: so he takes away our sins, not by having them imputed to him, as a Surety in our stead, but by removing them, which they explain in several respects. But to that place of <hi>Matthew,</hi> among other answers there are two most probable. First, of those who think both sins and bodily diseases are properly and literally intended, and so <hi>Peter</hi> applieth it to one, and <hi>Matthew</hi> to another; but some learned men dislike this, because, say they, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be two literal senses, or meanings of the same Text. And therefore in the second place, they say, by sorrows and griefs is directly and principally understood sins, but indirectly and by consequent bodily diseases, either because they come from
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118921:42"/> sin, or because our Saviour in curing of bodily diseases did principally look to sinne as the cause of them, and therefore told the healed person, <hi>Her sins were forgiven her.</hi> Thus Christ by taking our sins upon him, did thereby acquire a right and power to remove those punishments that follow sinne, and the Hebrew word <hi>Sabal,</hi> whatsoever may be said of <hi>Nasa,</hi> doth alwayes signifie <hi>to bear</hi> or <hi>carry,</hi> and not to <hi>take away:</hi> Oh then the unspeakable love of Christ in bearing our sins for us! This was more then to bear any outward calamity for us, for its sinne only that displeaseth God, and makes him offended. To this purpose is <hi>vers.</hi> 5. <hi>The chastisement of our peace,</hi> or <hi>our pacifications was upon him, and by his stripes we are healed.</hi> What can be more expresse then this? In him was no sinne found, but <hi>our iniquities bruised</hi> him, <hi>wounded</hi> him, <hi>crucified</hi> him; our sins were the <hi>spears</hi> that ranne into his side, we are all crucifiers of Christ, we may all say with <hi>Judas,</hi> We have not only betrayed, but even crucified the holy one: A sad meditation it should be to humblenesse: It followeth at <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all,</hi> he hath made to meet on him, as when many violent waters meet in one breach that is made, it hurrieth all away: Had not the Lord Christ been God as well as man, our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities would have carried him away like a torrent, he could not have stood in the gap to stop the wrath of God that was breaking out. Though these things were bitter to Christ, yet they cause unspeakable joy to the believer, for God will not require punishment for the same sins twice, he will not punish them in Christ, and in thee also: when justice shall make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition after thee, thou wilt be found in Christ, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slayer in the City of refuge. Here is an Altar from which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice may not take thee and destroy thee. As if the Prophet could not speak enough of this glorious mystery, he repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth again <hi>vers.</hi> 10. <hi>It pleased the Lord to bruise him,</hi> to grinde him to dust, and although this was so terrible, yet <hi>vers.</hi> 12. <hi>He poured out his soul to death,</hi> which denoteth the free and spontaneous offering himself to all this misery.</p>
                  <p>A second Text which confirmeth this reciprocal imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He who knew no sinne became sinne for us,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118921:42"/> that we might be made the righteousnesse of God in him.</hi> What can be clearer? This Text seemeth to be written in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, its so evident for our purpose. Christ though he had no sinne in himself, yet <hi>became sinne;</hi> if you take it but for a Sacrifice of sinne, it is enough; and indeed he could not be a Sacrifice for sinne, unlesse sinne was first laid upon him: And why is all this? We may say, That we who knew no righteousnesse, may become the righteousnesse of God in him; <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> and the <hi>righteousnesse of God,</hi> but <hi>in him.</hi> Thus we are <hi>Jacob</hi> in our elder brothers cloathes, as <hi>Ambrose</hi> of old hinted, which <hi>Calvin</hi> further amplifying, so affected <hi>Pighius</hi> the Papist, that he came off from his inherent righteousnesse, to that imputed by Christ. Now truly, what the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, Chap.</hi> 1. brake out into, <hi>Hear, O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and hearken, O Earth!</hi> in respect of that unnatural rebellion of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> we may, because of this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unheard of love, its more then any sinfull man da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth pray or hope for: That Christ should become thus a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for us, that he should be bound to loose us, guilty to free us; it should be received into our hearts, as such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable love, that we should even with the Church swound and faint away in the ravishments of it. And yet there is</p>
                  <p>A third Text that goeth higher, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us.</hi> What vassal could expect that his King should come and die an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious death that he may be set at liberty. Yet thus Christ did to us, and that his enemies, and rebels against him. This goodnesse of Christ is so transcendent, that we may justly conclude, Though one man had his heart full of as much love, as all the Angels and Saints collected together, yet he should cry out, I am straightned within, O my leannesse, my leannesse!</p>
                  <p>The last sort of Arguments may be taken <hi>from those places of Scripture, which expresly call Christs dying a Sacrifice for our sins.</hi> Now its the proper notion of a Sacrifice to expiate sinne, to reconcile God. Thus the Heathens, though they were guilty of horrible Idolatry, yet thus farre they had a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118921:43"/> true impression upon their consciences, that something must be done to pacifie God. Hence the Scripture doth so often attribute <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is to expiate sinne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. Now that Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Sacrifice thus for our sins, ye heard <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.10 and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the New Testament, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.2. where he is called not only <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which is alwayes applied to a bloudy Sacrifice. And the Apostle in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> especially <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.12. doth at large prove his Priestly office from this oblation of himself a Sacrifice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if this were done only doctrinally, as <hi>Socinians</hi> plead, he had no Priestly office at all. Now the Apostle sheweth all the <hi>Legal Sacrifices</hi> were only <hi>types</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> That it was not <hi>their bloud that could expiate sinne,</hi> but it must be <hi>Christs,</hi> neither will the <hi>Socinians</hi> exception avail, that onely the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <hi>anniversary Sacrifice</hi> for all the people, was only a <hi>type of Christ</hi> (though that indeed was more illustrious, and if granted is enough to confute their <hi>heresie</hi>) for all their <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Sacrifices</hi> were likewise a <hi>type of Christ;</hi> and therefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Christ</hi> is called our <hi>Passeover,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Baptist said, <hi>Behold the Lamb that taketh away the sin of the world:</hi> So that <hi>Christ</hi> being <hi>typified</hi> both in the <hi>publick Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>private,</hi> doth notably teach us, that we are not only in the general to look upon <hi>Christs</hi> death as <hi>expiatory</hi> of the sins of all the <hi>elect,</hi> but every godly man in particular is to appropriate the benefit of this Sacrifice unto himself.</p>
                  <p>Above all Sacrifices in the Law, that of the <hi>Scape-goat</hi> did palpably demonstrate <hi>Christ,</hi> for then the people in a solemn manner laid their hands on the <hi>Goat,</hi> thereby signifying, that as he was to perish, so they; only he was in their stead, and thus when their sins were laid on him, he was turned into the vast wildernesse, where they could never hear of him more. Though he was not killed, yet hereby he was exposed to death, and this did signifie that the sins of the godly being laid upon Christ, he bore them away even clear out of sight, so that they should never be charged upon the godly. Let then the godly soul believing say, Oh the depth, the breadth and height of this love of Christ being thus an expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

For it is in this Sacrifice, which is called <hi>a sweet savour to God,</hi> that he receiveth us: nothing from us can come but unsavoury and abominable, its in Christ onely we are accepted: As in a pure glass we may see loathsom and noisom carrion, but in the glasses representation of it, all the filthiness is taken away. As that Emperour, who in a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous jewel of a great quantity made like a glass, would behold through that, all horrid and deformed objects, which through that representation were made delightsom and acceptable. Thus in a well understood sense all the filth, the dross, the noisomness that is in our most holy duties being represented in Christ, hath their filthinesse done away: So that though not for our sakes, yet for Christs sake, God will become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with us; if thou to some unworthy man begging of thee in Christs name, doest rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That this Doctrine may the more clearly be apprehended, I shall adde further Propositions, the last running into many particulars.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Proposition is, <hi>That God in Christ crucified, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> with the benefits accrewing thereby doth at the same time demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate both mercy and justice, grace and righteousnesse. We are justified freely by his grace,</hi>

                     </gap>, there was no antecedent cause, or right in us to justification, and that by the bloud of Christ, as appeasing Gods wrath. So then, let not those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of Scripture, which testifie God forgiveth freely, and for his own name sake, make you doubt of Christs satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, saying with the <hi>Socinians, How can it be freely, and yet with satisfaction?</hi>

                     <note place="margin">How Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are of love and grace, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christs satisfaction.</note>
                     <hi>or opposition to that,</hi> as if a full price were not laid down, <hi>but to our works and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> In all those places where <hi>Paul</hi> doth mention the grace of God that we are justified and saved by his grace: The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate opposition, is not Gods justice, but <hi>Not of our selves, not by the works that we have done.</hi> Our Justification then is of pure meer grace in respect of us, but in respect of Christ it is of merit, it is of justice. Although therefore the justice of God be satisfied by Christs bloud, and so spiritual benefits are vouchsafed to us, yet all is of grace and meer love to us, and that in these particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>It was Gods infinite love to his, that made him finde out a way, and procure a Mediator for us.</hi> And thus the Scripture attributeth it to Gods love, that he sent his only Sonne into the world to die for us; God might have left us in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done estate, as he did the Angels, but he pitied us, and sent his Son to become a Sacrifice for us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Its the meer grace and love of God not only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Mediator, but to accept of him in our stead.</hi> For though Christs satisfaction was infinite, and could not be rejected by the Father as insufficient, for there was no defect in that, yet God was not rigidly bound in justice to accept of a Surety for us. But as God threatned, <hi>The day thou eatest thereof thou shalt die;</hi> and as the Rule is often mentioned in the Scripture, <hi>The soul that sinneth, that shall die;</hi> So might God have requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this satisfaction in our persons, that we in our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons must answer his justice, but yet such was his love and grace, that he admitted a Surety in our room, not <hi>abrogating</hi> his Law, but <hi>relaxing</hi> of it, as is to be more fully shewed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is yet further of grace, because we in this work of reconciliation bring nothing of our own, we were in the state of enemies and adversaries.</hi> So that every thing proclaimeth grace to us.</p>
                  <p>And fourthly, <hi>Its of grace, in respect of the application of this satisfaction and merit to our fouls;</hi> For how many, though Christ thus offered up himself, are yet damned, though
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118921:44"/> Christ was crucified, yet most will eternally perish; and why is all this? but because most refuse the benefits of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and so make themselves unworthy of his love, so that if any partake of these glorious benefits, it is because God doth make them differ from others. Its he that by his grace doth open their eyes, and change their hearts, whereby they hunger and thirst after this Redeemer. If therefore though Christ came into the world, yet his death may be in vain to thee, if thou through thy obstinacy mayest get no more good by Christ crucified, then the devils; then certainly such who are inabled and fitted to make use of Christ, they must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all is of grace to them.</p>
                  <p>Hence the fifth Proposition, <hi>That there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> mans forgiving another, and Gods forgiving us.</hi> Indeed we pray, that God would <hi>forgive us as we forgive them that trespasse against us.</hi> And to this purpose our Saviour brings in a Parable, shewing how we ought to forgive others, if we expect God should forgive us. But in this comparison, we must distinguish between mercy, and the manner of mercy. <hi>We are to be mercifull as God is,</hi> but in the manner God takes one way, and we another. This is evident, because we are commanded <hi>to forgive our enemies</hi> abiding enemies, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they refuse and reject our love; Whereas the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> confesse, That it would not stand with the honour of God to forgive all mens sins, even of such who wilfully continue impenitent and obstinate. Again, Man is a private person, and the offended party, and so being bound by the Law of a Superiour, it is his duty sometimes to forgive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out satisfaction (though in some cases he cannot) but God doth not forgive meerly as offended, nor is he to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a private person, but as the publick <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Governor</hi> of the world, who is thereby ingaged to <hi>judge righteously, and to render to every one according to his works:</hi> So that there is a vast difference between <hi>pecuniary debts and criminal,</hi> as you shall hear afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The sixth Proposition, <hi>Christ dying doth not thereby hinder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> the endeavour after, and exercising of our selves in all holy works.</hi> For thus the Adversaries urge.</p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:118921:45"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> The Doctrine of Christs satisfaction sets open a wide door to all impiety (say they) if Christ hath paid the debt and satisfied the Law, then we are not bound to pay it, and so we may live as we list.</p>
                  <p>But first we see, even the Apostles themselves could not preach the grace of God, but they had this poison suckt from the sweet herbs they planted, <hi>Rom</hi> 6.1. <hi>Christ and his benefits do not oppose holinesse, but do necessarily inferre it;</hi> for Christs death is not only for remission of sin, but <hi>to redeem us a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar people unto himself, zealous of good works.</hi> There is not only a <hi>moral connexion</hi> between Christs death and an holy life, <hi>viz.</hi> That a man by beholding Christs love should be moved to love him again; but there is a <hi>causal connexion,</hi> even as between the Sun &amp; the Sun-beams, between fire and heat: where the benefit of Christs death is, there is also his Spirit sanctifying and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into every good way. Indeed the true and proper answer is, That seeing Christ satisfied God, by his death and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. <hi>Therefore our obedience and sufferings are not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for that end, his was;</hi> we are not by our godlinesse to think of a compensation to God, ours cannot stand in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence if God enter into judgement; our tears for sinne are not to the same end his bloud was. But though holinesse and patience be not required of us to that end, for which it was in Christ, yet there are many other great and necessary reasons of it in the Scripture: And as for the <hi>Socinian</hi> this objection may be more strongly retorted on him, seeing he holds such a mercy and grace as forgiveth sinne freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any satisfaction that God is reconciled with all men; <hi>That there is no such attribute of justice in God,</hi> whereby he is inclined to punish sin. These notions must needs encourage in all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and wickednesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> The seventh Proposition, <hi>In this satisfaction and redemption of ours, the price was truly paid to God.</hi> It was God who acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted of the Sacrifice laid down for our sins. This is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, because the enemies of this truth ask,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If we were bought, who received the price? The <hi>Scripture</hi> saith, we were <hi>captives to the devil,</hi> and <hi>we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from our vain conversation.</hi> Therefore if a price be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118921:45"/> paid, its paid to the devil and our vain conversation, and how absurd is that to say?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> But the answer is, In our Captivity we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>principal</hi> that detaineth us, and the <hi>instrumental.</hi> The <hi>principal</hi> is <hi>Gods Justice,</hi> and his wrath, we are prisoners in the first place to that, but then the <hi>devil</hi> and <hi>sinne</hi> as its a punishment, are the under <hi>Jaylors,</hi> the serjeants to Gods wrath; and its not absurd to be redeemed from them, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Gods vengeance. Neither is that such an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity as the <hi>Socinians</hi> urge, that then God must satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which is (say they) as if a man should give money out of his purse to another, to bid him satisfie him; for the case of a <hi>pecuniary debt,</hi> and a <hi>crime</hi> are not alike, as the famous instance of <hi>Zaleucus</hi> witnesseth, who when a Law was made for the putting out of the eyes of an <hi>adulterer,</hi> and his own sonne, being found in that crime, he found an excellent temperament to satisfie the Law, by suffering one of his own eyes, and another of his sons to be put out. Besides in this work of redemption we are to acknowledge the peculiar or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and appropriated works of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> blaspheming, no wonder they split themselves at this rock, so that the satisfaction was common to all the <hi>three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> being <hi>God, Christ</hi> the second person, and the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> the third person required satisfaction as well as the Father, for they have one essential will, and justice; only the execution of this satisfaction, was by that wise temperament of sending the second person to become man, and die for our sakes.</p>
                  <p>In these things therefore there is infinite occasion to draw out our Faith and our Love, whether the truth or the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse be more wonderfull, its hard to say. Oh the depths of the counsels of God, may faith say! And oh the depths and goodnesse of God, may love say! If it were only an object to be believed, here was enough to take up the whole man, but being also an object to be loved and imbraced, How wide must our hearts be to receive such things? The truth of them is above thy understanding, and the goodnesse of them above thy heart. This Ocean cannot be received into thy little shell, they cannot enter into thy heart, do thou therefore enter
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118921:46"/> into them; be swallowed up in the faith and love of these things; and certainly <hi>Paul</hi> was so, when he desired to know nothing but Christ crucified; and when he said, he no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger lived, but Christ in him. Oh remember there are more glorious things to possess thy heart, then earthly vanities: This <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> is not to entertain every unclean thing.

                  <p>THere remain further Propositions to clear this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrine, That the Righteousness of God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by Christs blood shed for the Remission of sin.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> As first, <hi>Christs blood was not useless, though God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son to dye for us.</hi> For thus some urge, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                     </label> What necessity was there to satisfie Gods justice through Christ, seeing of his meer love he gave us Christ? if
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118921:46"/> therefore without any wrong to his justice, he could so love us as to give his only begotten Son, Why could not the same love pardon sinne, and give salvation without any injury un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his justice?</p>
                  <p>This Proposition therefore is to shew that there is a great difference between that love to mankinde by which he sent his Son into the world, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> and that more special and peculiar love, whereby he doth vouchsafe to some all saving privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. Its true, God without any breach of his justice did pity mankinde, and finde out a way for their pardon, but actually to pardon and save, that could not be without satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, at least supposing the Decree of God, and his reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will thus to punish sinne, and the reason of the difference between these two kindes of love is from the nature of them, one is a <hi>general</hi> love, as some call it a love of beneficence, whereby we are propense to do good, when a fit or lawfull way is found out: The other is a <hi>particular special</hi> love, and as some call it, a love of <hi>complacency</hi> and <hi>delight:</hi> now this cannot be in God towards a sinner, till his sinne which is so loathsom and abominable, be removed: We see the like case amongst men, A Judge who seeth a malefactor condemned by the Law, may for some just and powerfull reasons exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pity the malefactor, and may think of all such waies whereby the Law may be satisfied, that so the condemned person may be released; yet actually he cannot set him at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, unless he will be unjust, till the Law be satisfied. Thus the Scripture commends in God a <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> a love to mankinde, willing their good; but this cannot be actually performed till the <hi>justice of God be satisfied.</hi> He is mercifull, but he is also just and righteous, and therefore will shew his hatred and displeasure against sinne.</p>
                  <p>The second Proposition. <hi>Christs death, although the benefit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> of it doth not extend to all, yet was in it self a sufficient price and satisfaction to God.</hi> So that his righteousness is herein mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, though all be not saved. I shall not enter into that dispute, Whether Christs death was intentionally a price for all? or Whether considered in it self only, it be sufficient, though not efficacious for all? This is now to be asserted,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118921:47"/> That though such a price was laid down sufficiently for all, yet God is not unrighteous, if all be not redeemed, neither may we think that men are unjustly damned, because a price is paid for them, for we must distinguish between the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase</hi> or <hi>satisfaction</hi> it self, and the application of this, for though Christs satisfaction depend not on our faith, its not our beleeving that makes it a <hi>satisfaction to God;</hi> this it hath from its own inherent worth: yet that this <hi>satisfaction</hi> may be applied to us, and so become advantagious, there is faith required. Not that faith doth make Christs death effectual unto us, as if the benefit of that were suspended upon our beleeving, and our beleeving upon the uncertain use of our free will, for thus Christ might have died, and no man be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; no more good might have come to men then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state Angels, but that Christ by his death purchased such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits for those that should believe and receive him; yea and this very believing and receiving of him is also a fruit of his death, so that Christs death though it be an absolute price unto God and depends not on the condition of our frail strength, yet it doth not oppose such an order of means, in the use whereof he only will communicate the priviledges he purchased, so that if men do wilfully reject this price, they become guilty of their own damnation; as in the year of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee, if a servant would not accept of the liber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y offered, he was then to be a perpetual bonds man, and to have his ear boared as a sign thereof. Thus if thou wilt reject Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering thee liberty from sinne and hell, and that at so dear a rate, thou deservest to have thy ear boared, and to live and die Satans slave. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> proclaimed a liberty of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for every <hi>Jew</hi> into his own Country, if any loved <hi>Babylon</hi> better then <hi>Canaan,</hi> and so would not take the benefit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, the fault lay upon the man himself, whose will was thus corrupted. Thus it is with the price Christ hath paid, many do not apply the benefit of it, because they are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their hearts, and love their empty husks, better then the fatted calf in their fathers house: God therefore acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted of the price, yet so that the application of it is to be in the way and order God hath appointed, so that the damned
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:118921:47"/> in hell are not punished unjustly, as if God required satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction twice, once of Christ, and then in their own persons.</p>
                  <p>The third Proposition. <hi>Gods justice is satisfied, although <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> Christ did not indure the eternal torments of death:</hi> For it was impossible for him who was to be our Mediator, that he should be alwaies detained in his sufferings, and not be at last a Conquerour. Though therefore it be objected against Christs satisfaction, That he did not suffer the everlasting torments of hell, and therefore it could not be a sufficient price to Gods justice: Yet it is answered that Christs suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in his soul and body were <hi>equivalent</hi> to it: Although to to speak properly, eternity is not of the essence of death, which is the reward of sinne, and threatned by God, but its accidental, because man thus dying is never able to satisfie God; therefore seeing he cannot pay the last farthing, he is for ever kept in prison. As eternal death hath in it <hi>eternity</hi> and <hi>despair,</hi> necessarily in all those that so die, so Christ could not suffer; but what was wanting in duration, was supplied partly by the immensity of his sorrows, conflicting with the sense of Gods wrath because of our sinnes imputed to him, so that he suffered more grief, then if the sorrows of all men were put together; and partly by the dignity and worth of him who did suffer. Therefore the Scripture cals it <hi>the blood of God, Act.</hi> 20.21. Indeed this is not only rejected by <hi>Socinians,</hi> but others also have denied the sufferings of Christ in his soul through Gods displeasure for our sinnes imputed unto him, adding many other new doctrines, especially one of late, <hi>Pinchin</hi> in his Book called <hi>The meritorious price,</hi> &amp;c. But all those new assertions, blaming the common opinion as an universal error, are fitly to be examined, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, What is that righteousness which is imputed to us: for he makes neither the active or passive obedience imputed to us, though he grant Christ by a Mediatorial oblation of his body on the Cross to have satisfied the wrath of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we shall deferre the consideration of his Notion till that time, and in the mean while take it for granted, that <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.4, 5, 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.13. do prove that God laid our
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118921:48"/> sinnes on him, that he bore them by imputation, that he conflicted in his agonies with the wrath of God, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any sinne: So that although Christ did not suffer the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and the perpetuity of those hellish torments, yet he did equivalently satisfie the wrath of God, and recompence them some other way. And for the better understanding of this, we are to know (as hereafter is to be more largely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed) that <hi>Christ</hi> in some respects did, or suffered the <hi>idem,</hi> the very same that we should have done; in other respects <hi>tantundem,</hi> or that which is <hi>equivalent:</hi> As for example, It was necessary that Christ should suffer death, and the same kinde of death, <hi>viz.</hi> a cursed death for us. Therefore that position, though used in antiquity, That one drop of Christs blood was sufficient to redeem the whole world: Yea some Jesuites say, <hi>Nerinber de adoratione,</hi> that one drop of sweat, or the least praier of Christ, was enough to have saved a thousand worlds, because his person was so infinitely worthy, is not to be admitted: for his infinite worth is not all, Gods justice required death, and a cursed death, therefore the same; not a drop of blood, but death it self must be. But then in respect of some <hi>accidents</hi> to this death, as the <hi>eternity</hi> of it, or for the suffering of <hi>every kinde of pain</hi> that is the fruit of sinne, then an equivalent suffering was enough, it was not required he should suffer every kinde of curse which is the effect of sinne, but in the general a cursed death: And thus also it is in the fulfilling of the Law for us, it was not necessary that he should perform every holy duty, for he could not perform the obedience which Magistrates or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried persons are bound to do; its enough that there was a fulfilling of it in the general for us, for this was equivalent to every kinde of particular obedience, as his sufferings were to every kinde of suffering. Though therefore Christ did not suffer eternal death for sinners, yet he suffered that which was equivalent, and therefore the justice of God is by his death wholly appeased.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> The fourth Proposition. <hi>Though Christ the second person did thus voluntarily become a sacrifice for us, yet we are not to make such absurd conclusions as the Socinians do, That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118921:48"/> we are beholding to one Person more then the other.</hi> By this doctrine (say they) we are more bound to the Son then to the Father, and so are to love one more then another. Thus corrupt reason would make a dissention, where the Scripture affirmeth unspeakable agreement, for the work of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is to be attributed to the whole Trinity, as satisfaction was given to it, because they have an essential will and justice; only the fulfilling of this was by the second Person, and the assumption of our nature, though it was terminated in the Son, yet the counsel and appointment of it was from the whole Trinity; which the <hi>Ancients</hi> declared by a similitude of three sisters putting on a coat upon one of them; though no similitude can illustrate this, because of the infinite distance between the <hi>Creator</hi> and the <hi>creature;</hi> and indeed the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth in a very high manner commend both the love of the Father and the Son, in the Sonnes becoming an expiatory sacrifice for us: The Fathers love is declared in sending his only Sonne in the world, that which was dearer to him then many thousand worlds, and whose good was to be preferred above all mankinde; yet God sends him into the world, and upon this work, to die an ignominious death for us; and as God did thus send his Son into the world, so he did also lay this command upon him <hi>to dye for his sheep.</hi> Therefore <hi>John</hi> 14.10. he did as he received <hi>command of the Father.</hi> And by the Psalmist he declared <hi>to come and do the will of God, it was written in his heart.</hi> So that it was the Fathers will he should be <hi>thus bruised for our sinnes:</hi> yea he saith, <hi>Therefore the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loveth him, because he layeth down his life for his sheep, John</hi> 10.17. Thus you see the Fathers infinite love manifested, and then the <hi>Sons</hi> love, that is unquestionable, seeing he was so ready and willing to lay aside the manifestation of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to become in the repute of the worst of men for our sakes. Let us not then prophanely cavil at this glorious my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, but adore the love of the Father and the Son, in their mutual agreement for this our redemption. Had the Father been against it, then Christs sufferings would not have been accepted: Had the Son refused it, then still our condition had been desperate without a Mediator. But oh the depths
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118921:49"/> of Gods wisdom and love in finding out this way for our peace and comfort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> The fifth Proposition. <hi>Although Gods justice be declared by Christs death, yet we cannot inferre thence, that therefore Christs death was only in respect of God, and not in reference to us.</hi> For thus the adversaries argue, If Christ died to satisfie Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, then this work which is so commended in the Scripture as an instance of love and grace to us, would not relate to us, but mainly to God, that he might be satisfied: But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of one end, doth not exclude the other, yea it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily inferreth it; for the chief and ultimate end of Christs death is the glorifying of God, but then there are other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ends, as the satisfying of Gods justice, and by that all those inestimable benefits of Justification, Adoption and Salvation, which are attributed to Christs death likewise as the effects of it; so that because he died to appease the wrath of God, therefore he also died for our good: Hence is our reconciliation and peace with God made the fruit of his death: our sinnes provoked justice, and justice made a great gulf between Gods mercy and us, but Christ by his death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all these divisions away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> The last Proposition. <hi>Let it not seem strange that God thus required satisfaction ere he would pardon sinne, when yet man may and is commanded to forgive freely.</hi> This hath been the occasion of shipwrack to many, they judge of Gods remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes, after the manner of men forgiving one another, but here is a vast difference:</p>
                  <p>For first, The disputing of Gods absolute power, whether he can forgive without remission, is not here controverted: Its plain by the Scripture that he will not: so that seeing God will not accept of us without satisfaction, it behoveth us to conclude, that this is the wisest way and most honouring of God, seeing God doth all things for his glory.</p>
                  <p>And yet secondly, Even humane reason cannot but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend many dissimilitudes between a private mans forgiving another his trespass, and Gods forgiving us: as thus, Man is by God commanded to forgive his brother, not only hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling himself, but if he do not seek reconciliation: Hence is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:118921:49"/> that command of <hi>requiting evil with good,</hi> of blessing those that curse us: But now the adversaries themselves dare not but say, it would be a great dishonour, and unbeseeming the holy God, to forgive all sinne whether men repent or no: Who can apprehend that though wicked men do with all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and obstinacy, blaspheme and reproach God, that his pure eyes can without wrath behold all this? Its certain the Scripture represents God <hi>a consuming fire</hi> to such: that speaks of no mercy or favour, but the contrary, all wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to such as go on so wickedly.</p>
                  <p>Again, Even amongst men there are some trespasses that a man is not bound to forgive without satisfaction, neither can the party offended release the wrong, without sinne; as if a man murder another mans wife or childe, it is not in the mans power to release it, but he is bound to prosecute the revenge of it: and thus many cases may be given, wherein its not in a mans power to release his right, especially when it relateth to another, or when the Law of a superiour obligeth him, or the good of the publique doth require it: And although God have no superiour, and so cannot be bound by a Law above him, yet he is a Law to himself, so that he cannot but do wisely and righteously in all his waies.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, We are alwaies to distinguish between <hi>private</hi> men and <hi>publique</hi> persons; as also <hi>pecuniary</hi> debts, and <hi>criminal</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: It is true, a private man may remit a debt to his debtor, he is not bound to take any satisfaction; but a Judge in cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal causes, cannot without injustice forgive them. Now all sinne is committed against God as a publique person, as the Judge of the world; every sinne tends to the destruction of the universe: if it be let go unpunished, then all men will rejoyce in their wickedness, and think God is like one of them, as the Psalmist saith. If therefore Justice be so much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Magistrates for particular Societies, how much is it required to the whole Universe? The body can no more be compact without nerves and sinews, then the world without righteousness from God. Thus you have heard several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, which, if throughly understood, will confirm us against all those cavils which corrupt reason doth invent; for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118921:50"/> its from that bitter fountain that all bitter streams do flow; whereas the understanding is to be captivated to the Word of God, we captivate Gods Word to our understanding: and as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in another case, <hi>Deus non erit Deus nisi ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini placuerit.</hi> Having been thus large in the Doctrinal part, which was a shining light, let us be proportionable in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical, that it may be also burning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>1</label> And first, Doth <hi>God</hi> thus demonstrate his justice and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity against <hi>sinne,</hi> by Christs death? then let us take heed of love and delight in it: Why should that be pleasing to thee which filled Christ with so much bitterness? He was <hi>a man of sorrows,</hi> and wilt thou be a man of jollities? Was it a light matter that made him <hi>sweat drops of blood?</hi> Was it for nothing that he <hi>cried out, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Oh say of all sinne which thou hast greedily desired, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> of the water of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> he so longed for, That <hi>it was the blood of men,</hi> he would not meddle with it; but do thou say, <hi>This is the blood of Christ,</hi> the price even of Christs blood, and how then shall I pollute my self with sinne?</p>

                     <note place="margin">How we should aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our sins by Christs death.</note>Now the aggravation of sinne by Christs death, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, First, <hi>In the infinite evil of it,</hi> that it carrieth such guilt with it, that nothing could satisfie God but an infinite price; and this is true not only of gross enormous sinnes, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> also of the least sinnes: If all mankinde were but guilty of one sinne, and that the least thought which passeth away, yet there could not be any atonement made for it, but by Christs blood. Oh how should this make us tremble even at every idle word, idle thought! Oh say, This sinne cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted little, which is against so great a God, and needs such an infinite price! Let not then the customariness and universality of sinne make thee despise it; or do not say, This is but little, there needs not such ado; for the least sin thou art guilty of, can have no other atonement but by the blood of Christ. Little sins and great sinnes agree in this, they need a great Ransom.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. The aggravation of sinne appeareth, if we consider <hi>what Christ was who came to destroy it.</hi> All the wonderfull works that ever God did, the Creation of the world, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118921:50"/> of it, are nothing to this, that God should become man, and dye such a cursed ignominious death for us: In this mystery the Wisdom, Mercy, Justice and Power of God are made illustrious; now why was this? Shall we think the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was unnatural and cruel to his Son to deliver him up to such torments for a matter of no moment? No certainly. This should make us stand astonished at the depth, length, and breadth of our sinfulness, that such an unheard of remedy must be provided for us! Oh cry out, My soul is too narrow, my thoughts are too streightned! I may think and think, but never can think according to the nature of sinne. The remedy provided makes me see the desperateness of the malady.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This also may aggravate it, that though a man do truly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and bitterly humble himself for his sinnes, and acknowledge his rebellion, yet for all that, God will not pardon, without satisfaction by Christs blood: So that its not our tears, our praiers, our rendings of heart are able to expiate our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but it must be a work of infinite dignity to do this. <hi>God will have Christs blood and our tears also, but not for the same purpose.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Papists</hi> obscure this doctrine of Christs satisfaction, by adding their own. This is to divide the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory Office between Christ and man; neither can all their distinctions deliver them. Let us then be an Evangelical people, who fly to Christ only; mourn, pray and humble our selves we do, but its Christs blood only that can wash us clean, Let our eyes and hearts be fixed on him.</p>

Therefore there are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, who as they understood the former word of Gods goodnesse and mercy, so they do this also: And indeed it cannot be denied, but that righteousnesse doth many times signifie mercy; because as <hi>Dieu</hi> observeth <hi>in loc.</hi> all the just and righteous acts of God in overcoming the Churches ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, are a mercy to the Church.

                  <p>The righteousnesse of Gods word concerning our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Christ is seen,</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>By all those predictions and promises which were made for Christs coming into the flesh, and becoming both a Priest and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> King of peace for us.</hi> This was so notably spoken of, that all
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118921:52"/> the Jews were in expectation of them, though many of them carnally thought of a temporal Saviour otherwise: The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture saith, That both <hi>Moses and the Prophets testified of him, Act.</hi> 28.23. Its an unsound opinion, though some of the Ancients were taken with it, That the Fathers in the Old Testament by their holinesse did <hi>merit</hi> the Incarnation of Christ; for this is attributed wholly to the love of God; and certainly if Christs humane Nature did not merit its hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatical Union, much lesse could the believers of old, merit Christs coming into the world; Great are the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and precious are the promises of a Christ in the Old Testament: Therefore the Prophets when the people were in any outward calamities, did then comfort them with the coming of a <hi>Messiah,</hi> as <hi>Esay</hi> 9. and <hi>Micah</hi> 5. partly hereby to assure them, that even their temporal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er should not be totally destroyed till <hi>Shiloh</hi> came; and partly to teach the believers in all their publick straights, that though they had no outward peace, yet there was a spiritual peace procured with God through Christ; and therefore they were to rejoyce in Christ, when they had no earthly comfort to be glad of. Thus God shewed the truth of his promises, when in the fulnesse of time Christ came. Not as if Christ had not any Subsistence before he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnated, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> blaspheme: for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the wildernesse are said <hi>to tempt Christ;</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Moses</hi> in his dayes is said <hi>to esteem the reproaches of Christ above the treasures of Aegypt;</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. The Spirit which was in those Prophets of old, is called <hi>the Spirit of Christ.</hi> Christ then was in respect of his Divine Nature before his Incarnation, and all the godly in the Old Testament had benefit by him as well as in the New, for God had respect to that oblation which Christ was to offer in time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>Gods righteousnesse of truth in respect of his words, was also manifested in our Justification by Christs death.</hi> For <hi>Genes.</hi> 3. God made this threatning to <hi>Adam, In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die.</hi> This sentence was passed from Gods own mouth, its irrevocable: So that whatsoever might
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118921:52"/> be said in respect of Gods absolute power to do otherwise, yet hypothetically supposing this commination, it would be unjust if death should not be required for sinne. Its true there is a difference between a Threatning and a Promise. In a Promise, God doth, as it were, become a debtor to man, he giveth a man so qualified right to claim such a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of him, though in respect that by this Promise man is not alienated, or the thing promised from his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is not properly a debtor to man, for that is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but to himself, he cannot be unfaithfull to himself, yet we acknowledge this fulfilling of his promise is attributed not onely to love or faithfulnesse, but righteousnesse also, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. But in a threatning we cannot say properly that the delinquent hath a right to be punished, though he doth deserve it, or that God becomes in any respect a debtor to the sinner to punish him, yet in regard God is truth it self and immutable, no <hi>io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a</hi> or <hi>tittle</hi> of any threatning shall fall to the ground: Let not the wicked man dream of such a mercy as shall infringe Gods truth; let him not fancy such a pardon, as doth contravene any threatning; Seeing therefore God hath peremptorily set down such a Law, that upon sinne there must be death, and this must stand, though heaven and earth should fall, it was altogether becoming the Justice of God, that if the sinner himself did not die, yet there must be one in his stead, that so the Law may be satisfied.</p>
                  <p>But then here is the grand Objection, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                     </label>
                     <hi>If Gods Justice be required for the fulfilling of that Law, how can that be, seeing the sinner himself doth not die, but an innocent one in his room,</hi> the just for the unjust, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18? which is tragically ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> as if the Orthodox attributed unheard of cruelty and injustice to God; And indeed thus farre the Doubt seemeth to have a specious ground, How is Gods righteousnesse seen in the fulfilling of this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? Or how is this threatning made good, seeing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son threatned, <hi>If thou eat thou shalt die?</hi> And as in the Hebrew, <hi>Dying thou shalt die,</hi> viz. <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly, did not,</hi> or <hi>doth not die;</hi> but an innocent one, who
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118921:53"/> knew no sinne, is substituted in his room.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> But this is easily answered, <hi>Though the strict letter of the threatning required the sinner himself to die, yet it did not exclude, or forbid a Surety to come between.</hi> God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed said, the sinner shall die, but not he in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son onely: So that though another should offer himself in his room, yet I will not accept of him; if God had done this, he had not onely shut man out of the terrestrial Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, but from all hopes also of the heavenly one, he had made their condition like that of the devils, and every man beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for pardon, would have had no more hope then <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> had for a drop of water in hell. But God made no proviso in that threatning against a Surety, therefore that Law was not directly broken, and yet it was not exactly fulfilled neither. What was it then? Learned men say, That God did not by this accepting of a Surety for us abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate that Law, for then wicked men who reject Christ, could not be damned in their own personal impieties. We see God in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> still continuing a Law like this, <hi>The soul that sinneth it shall die,</hi> Ezek. 18.4. Its not then an abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law; nor yet in the second place is it a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the threatning, for then it is properly a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when some by special priviledge are exempted from a Law, which otherwise obligeth all: but this could not be, for all mankinde was involved in it, and Christ needed not a priviledge to be exempted from it, for he was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in it. Nor was it an equitable interpretation of the Law, for that is, when upon the reason of the Law, although not the Letter of the Law, a person is found never at first to be intended by it: but it was a <hi>relaxation,</hi> or rather a mercifull condescension of the Law-giver by his goodnesse and wisdome to finde out an expedient, or happy temperament: So that the Law might be satisfied, yet man finde mercy. Thus it was <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, it was not exactly according to Law, nor yet properly against it, but it was above it, and yet for it, for thereby death for sinne was brought about.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:118921:53"/>
                  <p>Thus you have heard Gods righteousnesse in his word abundantly declared by Christ dying to obtain our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But the main and principal particular is,<note place="margin">The righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Gods work.</note>
                     <hi>To shew the righteousnesse of Gods work herein, or that it was an instance of that Justice in him, whereby he will punish sinne.</hi> For seeing the Scripture describeth his Nature to be such, that he is holy, that he loveth no sinne, that he is displeased with it, and abhorreth it, it was necessary therefore there should be a demonstration of this Attribute of God, but if it were onely of Justice, then there would be no decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Mercy. The wise God hath therefore so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, that there should be eminent demonstrations both of his Mercy and Justice. Gods Justice therefore in our Justification is seen, in that the Lord <hi>Christ</hi> laid down his life by way of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to God. He died not onely to shew us an example of Patience and Obedience; but the principal end of his death was to <hi>expiate our iniquities,</hi> and to be <hi>Satisfactory to the Justice of God.</hi> Now that this truth, though full of Comfort, yet of difficulty also, may be the better understood, we are to take notice of these things.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That in the Lord Christs work of Redemption for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> us, Divines do speak of Christs Merit, and his Satisfaction.</hi> And although the Scripture doth not expresly use such words, yet it hath that sense and meaning which is intended by them, onely these two words have a different <hi>Notion;</hi> for <hi>Merit</hi> that doth properly respect the Subject for whom the good thing is <hi>Merited;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The difference between Merit and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</note> but <hi>Satisfaction</hi> doth in the first place relate to the good of the person that is <hi>satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Thus Christ by his Merit did aim at those heavenly mercies, which we are to enjoy by him; but in his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction he did in the first place look to God, that his Glory and Honour might be repaired, which was obscured by sinne, yet this is not so to be understood, as if <hi>Christs Satisfaction</hi> did not also redound to our good; for in that God is <hi>Satisfied,</hi> there is thereby a way made for our <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>Salvation;</hi> yea God would have his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118921:54"/>
                     <hi>Satisfied,</hi> that so a way might be made for the Effects of his Grace. Again, There is this difference between <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction; Merit</hi> doth properly respect the Good that is to be procured, but <hi>Satisfaction</hi> the Evil that is to be repelled: howsoever, in Christ we are not to make such distinctions, for in his <hi>Merit</hi> was a <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and in his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, Merit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Consider this, <hi>That the Schoolmen distinguish between Satisfaction and Satispassion. Satisfaction</hi> they make a voluntary willing undergoing of such a punishment God will have: And thus Christs Satisfaction was free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, when the <hi>Psalmist</hi> said, <hi>Sacrifice and Oblation God would not have,</hi> then saith Christ, <hi>Loe I come to do thy will, O God,</hi> Psal. 40.8. <hi>Loe, I come,</hi> that denoteth the willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and promptnesse in him, to a task so bitter and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to flesh and bloud. But <hi>Satispassion</hi> is, when the party doth unwillingly suffer such a punishment, as God in his Justice shall inflict on him; hence, they say, that the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in hell, they do <hi>satispati,</hi> but not <hi>satisfacere,</hi> because all those eternal torments are inflicted on them against their will, which is the cause they rage and gnash their teeth with everlasting howlings and roarings of spirit; yet this is not to be understood so, as if they did suffer enough to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense God, and make amends for the disobedience they are guilty of. No, if they could do so, then they would at last be acquitted, and set at liberty from those hellish chains of darknesse; but because they are never able to satisfie, they are to all Eternity chained up in their misery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>To every true and proper Satisfaction, there are four things required,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Four things requisite to true and proper Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to prove Christs Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</note> which were all seen in <hi>Christs Oblation</hi> of himself.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>There is required that it be done to another;</hi> for a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be said to satisfie himself.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That it be amongst equals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That it be in such things as are the parties own that doth sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:118921:54"/>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>That it be in such things that are not due to him</hi> who is <hi>satisfied</hi> by some other title or consideration.</p>
                  <p>I shall not at large treat on these, for I handle the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory work of Christ in our Redemption onely, as thereby is discovered the Justice and Righteousnesse of God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some declaration of these particulars, will make you to assent to the whole truth, <hi>viz. That God doth not deliver us from hell and sin by his meer Power, nor by meer Mercy, but of Justice and Mercy conjoyned together.</hi> I shall touch of them.</p>
                  <p>For the first, Satisfaction being a part of Justice, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in its very Nature being to another, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> How could Christs Oblation of himself be a Satisfaction, seeing Christ was God also? it seemeth absurd for a man to satisfie himself. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty is much discussed by the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and the <hi>Socinians</hi> they also urge it.</p>
                  <p>And to answer it, Some say, that whereas Justice is alwaies said to be <hi>ad alterum,</hi> that is taken from <hi>Aristotle</hi> and other Philosophers, who were altogether ignorant of this Divine Mystery; so that as they would say of Obedience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, it must be alwayes of an Inferiour to a Superiour, yet we know that Christ, who was God-man, was in a state of <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and that unto himself, as God. But because not onely <hi>Philosophers,</hi> but even the <hi>natural light</hi> of reason doth convince, That in <hi>Satisfaction</hi> there must be two extreams, <hi>The party satisfied,</hi> and <hi>The party satisfying,</hi> or at least two distinct considerations; Therefore that is reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by some.</p>
                  <p>Others they say, It is not absurd to reason, to say, a man <hi>satisfieth himself,</hi> that is, his <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Its absurd to say, A Magistrate, who having made such a penal Law, and yet willing to spare some Delinquent for just reasons, when he findes out a way to satisfie the Law, in procuring such an expedient, that he satisfieth himself.</p>
                  <p>But the best answer is, <hi>That though Christ be God, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as Mediator, as God-man, so there is a distinct respect from him as meerly God.</hi> Now he <hi>satisfied</hi> as he was God-man,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118921:55"/> and in respect of his Mediatory Office he is to be considered, as distinct from the absolute consideration of his person, as <hi>God;</hi> and this the Apostle insinuates, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. when he saith, <hi>A Mediator is not a Mediator of one,</hi> that is, there must be two parties at distance, where there is a Mediation; and thus God was as absolutely considered, and man as absolutely considered: Therefore Christ he was first <hi>medius,</hi> did partake of both Natures; and then a Mediator, did accomplish that Office for us: Even as <hi>Aaron,</hi> when Gods wrath was consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the offenders, he stood with his <hi>Incense</hi> between the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and the dead; This did typically represent the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Christs death, its he alone that stands between the damned and saved. Its true, here are not distinct <hi>supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tums</hi> in Christ, but the two distinct Natures is enough to cause such a difference that we may discern the offended and him who makes the Satisfaction, and indeed the excellency of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction lieth in the equality of the compensation, not in the real diversity of the extreams; so that though in Justice amongst men there may in this respect be a more perfect way of Satisfaction, because one man doth <hi>quoad suppositum</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from another, yet in respect of that compensation, it hath a transcendency above all humane <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and its no wonder for a thing to be exceeded by another in its generi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Nature, but that to exceed the other in its specifical nature. As the heavens in their body, which is a generical nature, doth exceed mans, but mans in its specifical exceedeth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. Thus in Christs Satisfaction we may consider a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the party <hi>satisfied,</hi> and him that makes the <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. In true and proper <hi>Satisfaction</hi> there must be also an equality; for although the party satisfying by his humiliation and submission, doth for a while subject himself as an Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, yet unlesse he had an equal dignity with the party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, he could not forgive him out of justice, but of grace and liberality. Now thus it was with Christ, if we consider him in respect of his Mediatory Office, so he is inferiour to the Father; and in this respect was in a state of humiliation; and hence it is that he referreth all glory to his Father, that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118921:55"/> he saith, he <hi>cometh to do his Fathers will,</hi> and that his Father is greater then he; but then consider him in his Person, as God, so there is an equal dignity with God, and by this means all those acts of his humiliation, and of his most reproachful sufferings, had a <hi>Satisfactory power</hi> in them, yea the lower he humbled himself, and the more he was despised, the more did his dignity discover it self: for how more noble and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the person is who submits himself unto a mean action, the meaner that is, the more dignity is thereby put upon it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In Christs Satisfaction there was a compensation unto God of his own;</hi> he was not bound to suffer that death, neither though he was made man was he bound to be on earth in an obedient way to the moral command, but he might have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mans nature, and immediately have glorified himself in heaven: Its true, supposing the end, why Christ came into the world, he could not but be in an obedient way to the moral Law: but so also supposing this end it could not be but that he must suffer; Therefore the Scripture puts a necessity upon it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.26. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                     <hi>The Sonne of man must suffer, and so enter into his glory,</hi> but more of this hereafter, as being a main point for those who deny Christs active obedience imputed to us, but yielding that his passive is, say contrary to what he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that Christ was bound as a creature in respect of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature to obey the moral Law, and so fulfilled that for himself, and not for us, and therefore it could not be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us; but the falshood of this will appear hereafter; for the present we see, that <hi>Christ</hi> both in respect of his <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>sufferings</hi> was wholly <hi>voluntary,</hi> and in an absolute sense not due to God any other wayes: and so comes in</p>
                  <p>The fourth particular, <hi>That as Christ was our Mediator from that which was his own, so also that which he did in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, he was not bound to do upon any other title to God, for if it had been due otherwise, then in all reason it could not have been for us, but for himself.</hi> Its true his humane nature had all it had from God, for being a creature could not obey the will of God, or endure the conflicts of that dreadful death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out assistance from God, therefore an Angel was sent to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him: but being this humane nature was personally united
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:118921:56"/> to the God-head, and so he was in a most <hi>ineffable</hi> manner, <hi>God and man;</hi> hence it is that what he did, was of himself, and his own, therefore he said, <hi>He had power to lay down his life, and to raise it up again,</hi> Joh. 10.18. If then these particulars were by a lively meditation amplified, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ so full of dignity and glory in himself, even equal to God, would yet submit himself to the most shamefull and terrible torments that could be, to procure our peace and ransome; if (I say) this were powerfully thought on: Oh the astonishment and enlargings of heart it would make in thee! Nothing would grieve thee so much as the naughtinesse of thy heart, coldness and formality in holy duties: How sadly wouldst thou check thy self? saying, Did Christ work out my redemption with no more fervency and diligence then I pray or hear his Word? How impossible would my salvation have been, if he had as unwillingly undertook the Mediatory Office for me, as I am many times to do his will? Oh, he could say with all readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>Loe I come to do thy will, O God!</hi> though this will was to be bruised and wounded for my transgressions: but I am cold and drawing back, when I am to do his will, though it bring much joy and peace with it: Oh these dull and heavy hearts of ours! but as the Artificer hath his Engine to screw up the heaviest timber to the top of the house: so though thy heart be earthly, stupid, inclining downward, yet the consideration of Christ dying for us, should be an admirable Engine to draw our hearts upwards.</p>

                  <p>THe truth to be demonstrated is, <hi>That not only Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but his Justice is declared in our Justification.</hi> That which the <hi>Socinians</hi> deride as inconsistent, <hi>viz.</hi> a free Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinne, and yet a full Satisfaction, we see the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture maintains, not indeed in the same respect, and to the same subject, for its a gracious pardon to us, though it be of justice to Christ who paid the debt.</p>
                  <p>The last time we shewed, it was a true and proper Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which Christ made by his bloud for our sins. It was not an improper or metaphorical one, it had all the <hi>requisites to Satisfaction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place we say, it was not onely a <hi>true Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> but it was a <hi>copious plentifull one,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Christs Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction a copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full one.</note> it was superabundant to our sins. There is not so much evil in them as there is good in Christ. There is not so much offence in them to God, as there is honour to him by Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. Christ being there by the Apostle exalted above the legal Priests, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:118921:57"/> to be every way fit and full for our Redeemer, its said, <hi>He is able to save us to the uttermost;</hi> he hath not left one farthing unpaid; There is not any great sinne or little sinne that will be charged upon thy score: Oh think not, If I had not been so great a sinner, if I had never been defiled with such and such transgressions, then there might have been some hope! This is to undervalue Christs Redemption, this is to think there is more in sinne to damn, then in Christs obedience to save. Whereas thy sins are to Christ but as a little Cloud to the glorious Sunne, his obedience exceeds thy transgressions as much as his person doth thy person. Now then, if he being God, all the Nations of the world are but as one drop to him; so also must their sinnes be; if therefore thou hadst all the sinnes of all men in the world upon thee, they would be but as a drop to that ocean. This is not spoken to encourage the presumptuous sinner, for alas he hath no part in this Satisfaction, but to comfort the humbled sinner loaden with the sense of his sinnes. Though they are a burden greater then he can bear, yet not then Christ can endure, yea take quite away. Thus <hi>John</hi> 10.10. Christ came, <hi>That his sheep might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly,</hi> even more then enough; therefore its so often called, <hi>The riches of his grace.</hi> There is an infinite trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, able to satisfie thee and others also. In it self indeed it is a ransom sufficient to redeem all sinners, yea a thousand worlds of sinners, for the price is not the more diminished, though it be extended to never so many. As the Sunne hath fulnesse of light to enlighten all in the world; if the blinde do not see by it, its thine indisposition, not any scarcity of light in the Sunne: Thus it is here; if all men are not acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Christs death, its not because that was insufficient, as if it had not vertue enough to reach to thee as well as others; but by thy unbelief thou rejectest this soveraign remedy, otherwise there is an overflowing fulnesse in this satisfaction; thy cruise will sooner fail to receive it, then the oil be defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: Oh then what large room hath faith to expatiate in! Sit down and dive and dive, yet thou canst not come to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Christs bloud, but as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw still
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118921:57"/>
                     <hi>more and greater abominations,</hi> so mayest thou in the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Obedience of Christ every day discover more and more fulnesse: Its like digging where a spring and fountain is, that riseth up higher and higher, even till it come <hi>like the waters of Noah,</hi> to exceed the highest hils, even the most sublime meditations that can be; and that we may be fully assured of this truth, see what a notable opposition the Apostle makes <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. between the first and second <hi>Adam,</hi> at large proving that Christ doth superabound in the <hi>fruits of his grace</hi> above the first <hi>Adam</hi> in the <hi>effects of his sin,</hi> he cals it <hi>grace,</hi> and the <hi>abundance of grace,</hi> and this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grace <hi>reigneth to life.</hi> So that these Texts should be like so much oil poured in the wounds of every broken-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sinner; What can satisfie him if this do not? Is there any thing that can be desired more then this? What though sin by <hi>Adam</hi> be thus potent, yet righteousnesse by Christ is more prevailing, so that we give not Christ the honour due unto him, while we are dejected through unbelief, and thy sins seem great, but not Christs obedience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Its not only a <hi>full and true Redemption, but its a perfect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> satisfaction,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Christs Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one.</note>
                     <hi>the acceptance of Christs death did arise from the infinite worth and condignity of it, not from the meer favour of God.</hi> Indeed all those <hi>Schoolmen</hi> called the <hi>Nominals,</hi> they say, that the ground of Christs Satisfaction was from the kinde acceptance and benevolence in God, and therefore they make it to be of as much favour that God did accept of Christs satisfaction, as if it had been of a pure meer man, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they grant there was more congruity in Christ to be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, then a meer man, because he was God also. Hence <hi>Durand</hi> is not afraid to say, that as by <hi>Adam</hi> we were made sinners; so by the same <hi>Adam</hi> we might have been made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, <hi>Distinct.</hi> 21. <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. Thus <hi>Vorstius</hi> while wavering did acknowledge <hi>Christs Satisfaction,</hi> but yet placed the ground of it in Gods gracious acceptance and receiving of it, <hi>Lubb. Error.</hi> 55. which certainly doth much dishonour <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>expiatory Sacrifice,</hi> he made for our sins. Indeed the Orthodox do acknowledge in a sound sense the necessity of Gods <hi>gracious acceptance of Christs Satisfaction,</hi> not as if that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:118921:58"/> were not in it self Satisfactory from its worth, but because God was not bound to accept of a Surety in our stead, he might have charged the threatning upon our own persons, and so we our selves be charged with all the guilt of sinne. There could be no necessity either Natural or Moral, obliging or enforcing of him to receive a satisfaction by another: So that in this respect it was Gods favour, to accept of Christs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for us. Again, Christ as a Mediator, is wholly the gift of God. The Scripture makes it Gods meer love to send his Sonne into the world, Christ did not merit to be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, the appointment of him for that office is attributed by Scripture wholly unto the love of God and his grace: So that it cannot be called perfect satisfaction in this sense, as if Christ by his death did so purchase our Reconciliation, that God could not in justice refuse it, for it was wholly of Gods favour that Christ was fore-ordained to be our Mediator. But then if we consider the benefits accrewing to the godly by Christs death;<note place="margin">In what sense Christs Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> these were obtained by a full and perfect satisfaction, that is, God did not by way of grace, supply what was imperfect, or indulge any defect in Christs work of our Redemption, but <hi>there was an inward equality and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity between the price paid, and the mercy obtained;</hi> and this is fully proved, because the Scripture when it speaks of Christs death, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10, 14. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doth alwayes attribute Gospel-mercies to <hi>his death,</hi> and not to the grace of God. It makes the ground and cause of mercies not to be the favour of God, but the works that Christ hath wrought; therefore it speaks farre otherwise of Christ, then of the works of a godly man, <hi>When it saith the godly are saved, presently it excludes the works we do, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all to Gods grace; but when it speaks of Christ, there his righteousnesse and works are acknowledged.</hi> Though <hi>Paul</hi> would not be <hi>found in his own righteousnesse,</hi> yet he is not afraid, but desireth to be in <hi>Christs righteousnesse;</hi> he knoweth no blemish, no fault or insufficiency can be found in that: So that we evidently see Christs satisfaction, is, 1. A true, proper one. 2. A plentiful and an abundant one. 3. A full and perfect one. It had in the way of Satisfaction all that God could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:118921:58"/> so that there cannot be a more compleat Satisfaction then this.</p>
                  <p>Hence fourthly, <hi>This obedience of Christs it was more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> to God then all the sins committed by the elect,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">More satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to God then all the sins of the elect are displeasing to him.</note>
                     <hi>are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spleasing to God.</hi> God took more delight in his humiliation, and smelt a sweeter savour in his Sacrifice, then all our sins could offend him. Thus you heard from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>gift</hi> through Christ in making righteous, did <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abound</hi> the filthinesse of sinne in making a sinner: from this it is that God would never have suffered sinne to be, had he not thereby produced a better good then sinne could be evil. This certainly should admirably support the drooping soul: Oh thy sins afflict thee! Thou mournest because of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and unkindenesse that hath been in thy iniquities, thou cryest out, Its not my misery, my destruction trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth me so much, as that God is offended: Oh every thing within me trembleth, while I consider God is displeased! Let this contrite spirit but turn the eye the other way, and there it may behold Christ giving God as much honour, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying his holy will, as ever thy iniquities had injured him: Oh now (God saith) fury and wrath is not in me, I have no more quarrel and controversie with thee; that Christ is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thus obedient to the Crosse, its enough, I have as much as my justice could demand, my frowns are turned into smiles, my rod of iron into a Scepter of grace; certainly the meditation of this should be health in thy bones, and wine to thy heart; What is that thought wherein thou art intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the day long, but this? God is offended with my dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, sloathfulnesse, and my thousand imperfections: Oh I am loathsome in my own eyes, much more in Gods: If <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> was afraid of <hi>Laban;</hi> if <hi>Jacob</hi> was afraid to meet <hi>Esau</hi> his brother, when yet he was innocent, and had given no just cause of offence, much rather may I tremble, who provoke God all the day long: but then when I look upon Christs sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, then I am acquitted: if there be no charge against Christ, no accusation against him, there is none against me. Shall <hi>Jacob</hi> then so rejoyce in seeing <hi>Esau</hi>'s face altered to him? Shall he say, <hi>I have seen thy face as the face of God?</hi>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:118921:59"/> How much rather may the humble and beleeving sinner be filled with gladnesse, when through Christs bloud God shall be thus appeased and reconciled with him! if thy unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse make thee diffident, so that thou canst not plead Gods free grace; yet here is an argument put in thy mouth from Christs expiatory Sacrifice, that thou mayest say, O Lord, I am unworthy, but it is just and right that Christ obtain what he died for! Its grace to me, but it is righteousnesse to Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Fifthly, <hi>We are to consider in sinne two things, the</hi> malum creaturae, <hi>and the</hi> malum Dei. The evil of the <hi>creature</hi> is that noxious and damnable effect of it, whereby it instateth a man in a condition of all misery; the evil towards <hi>God</hi> in sinne is that whereby it doth injure and offend him, being nothing but contempt of him, and if it were possible work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very destruction of God: Now Christ by his death doth satisfie God for sinne, principally and in the first place, as it is offensive to God, as it dishonours him; and then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily and by redundancy, as its destructive of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for if we remove the cause, we take away the effect; if the dishonour and offence to God be removed, then is the destructive and damnable effects of sinne also taken away; onely by this we should learn, in all our humiliation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement for sinne, to be affected with that which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est evil in it. Christ in all those unspeakable agonies of his, did satisfie chiefly for sinne, as it was Gods offence, as it was a dishonour to him; so should our hearts be broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite within us, mainly because we have offended him, as <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 51. <hi>Against thee, thee onely have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight,</hi> because it was against God, and in his sight, this brake his bones, this pounded his heart to dust. It was not his childes death, nor all the other miseries accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying his sinne, that did so break and bruise him, as that God was hereby displeased: Oh then that we were such a spiritual people, that could apprehend what is most to be bewailed in our transgressions; if fear of judgements and hell be the onely and alone cause of all thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, thou art not yet so spiritual, as thou oughtest to be:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118921:59"/> The losse of Gods favour should be more unto thee, then all temporal evils.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>The righteousnesse of God and his Justice is seen in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Christs Satisfaction from a threefold respect.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The infinite worth of Christs obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from three grounds.</note> There are three grounds of the infinity of worth in Christs obedience, and therefore it being then infinite upon all those Titles, its plain, that God would not forgive only by grace, but by justice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. The infinite worth of his obedience did arise,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From the dignity of his Person,</hi> he was God-man; so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that all the obedience of Angels and men if put together, could not amount to the excellency of Christs Satisfaction: Stand amazed at thy happinesse, O believer, thou hast gained by thy losse, thou hast lost the obedience of a creature, but the obedience of an infinite person is now made thine; hence its many times called the righteousnesse of God; among other reasons, because its such as God is satisfied with, he looketh for no better, yea there can be no better. Though God hath infinite treasures of wisdom and omnipotency, yet he cannot provide a better obedience for us then this is: As God cannot love a better object then himself; This is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, but potent perfection, whether this infinite dignity derived from the person of Christ to his actions, be a <hi>physical entity</hi> affecting the operations, or a <hi>moral relation</hi> by way of resultancy, though disputed by <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> yet must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be granted, that its a <hi>moral relation,</hi> and so derived to every mediatory action: as if the whole value of money were only from the stamp and superscription it beareth; then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the materials were gold, or silver, or iron, or leather, it would be nothing to the purpose, the stamp would make it to be of like worth; seeing therefore that Christ in all his mediatory actions, was God as well as man, thereby was an infinite dignity communicated to them (I say <hi>his</hi> mediatory actions) because some question whether Christ did not many humane actions that were either wholly indifferent, or to a meer natural end, and no higher, but that must needs be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to Christ, because <hi>To us he was born, to us he was given, to us he lived, and to us he died.</hi> All that Christ was, and did, or suffered, did mediately or immediately tend
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118921:60"/> to our Redemption, and our Saviour intended that in all things.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>It was infinite, not only in respect of the dignity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but also</hi> respectu rei obla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ae, <hi>the price offered, which was himself a Sacrifice for our sins;</hi> which made the Apostle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this thing above that by <hi>gold</hi> or <hi>precious stones;</hi> So that if we consider what that price or oblation was, we must needs grant an infinite dignity to it.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>It was infinite in respect of the manner of the oblation; or the whole mediatory Office of Christ was discharged in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that it did also merit at Gods hand.</hi> It is true the habitual and actual grace of Christ in his humane nature, was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively infinite, for so onely God is; but because of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal union, there was infinite worth redounding to every thing he did: yet seeing the grace and holinesse of Christ, which he shewed in all that he did, was not limited, as in creatures <hi>(for he received not the Spirit in measure.)</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy manner of doing all things God required, was acceptable unto God.</p>

                     </label> And if you object, Seeing that the dignity of Christs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son did put such infinite worth upon what Christ did; Why then did not any one action satisfie? Why might not that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acceptance, which he declared, <hi>Behold, I come to do thy will, O God!</hi> have been enough without death it self? What need many actions of infinite dignity, seeing there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more then infinite?</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> To this it is answered, That infinite worth, simply as so, is not enough, unlesse it be ordered and proportioned accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of him, who is to be satisfied; for if a man should give for a captive prisoner an infinite summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, yet if not according to such a way and a condition, as the conquerour prescribeth, though that summe of money were sufficient in it self to redeem a thousand such as that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner is, yet because not according to the condition prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, it could not be called a Satisfaction. And thus because Gods will was, that a sinner should die, though never so many glorious actions, having an infinite dignity, were accomplished; yet they could not be Satisfaction,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:118921:60"/> as to this matter, unlesse there be such a death as was threatned.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Because Christ in his Mediatory Office, was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> thus infinitely worthy: Hence it is that no meer creature, Angel nor man, though endowed with all imaginable perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, could satisfie for mans sinnes.</hi> Some of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have concluded the contrary, asserting, That a pure creature might have satisfied: but as the Apostle argued, <hi>If righteousnesse come by the Law, then Christ died in vain;</hi> So if Salvation and Justification could come any other way, then Christ did needlesly endure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll those torments and agonies; and certainly it cannot be thought that Christ should put himself into such a state of Humiliation, if any supposed creature could have done it. That is true of <hi>Leo,</hi> If he had not been man, <hi>non praeberet exemplum,</hi> he could not have given us an example; and if he had not been God, <hi>non praeberet remedium,</hi> he could not have procured a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Therefore they do dangerously erre, who hold Christ a Mediator onely in his humane Nature, as that <hi>Itan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carus</hi> of whom its reported, <hi>Andr. Osiand. Disput.</hi> that he would say, There was more in <hi>Peter Lumbard,</hi> (who held Christ a Mediator according to his humane nature) then there was in an hundred <hi>Luthers,</hi> two hundred <hi>Melancthons,</hi> or four hundred <hi>Calvins.</hi> But if Christ were wholly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator as man, then man as man might make an atonement to the infinite Justice of God, which is impossible: seeing whatsoever such a supposed creature could do, was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the gift of God; and the more he did, the more he was obliged to God: Now Satisfaction could not be if all were of grace and Gods bounty; and in this sense it is, that <hi>Calvin</hi> said, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Institut. cap.</hi> 17. If we should absolutely and simply oppose Christ to the judgement of God, there could be no place for merit, because in man there could not be found any such worth. This reason doth plainly evince, That <hi>Calvin</hi> speaks of Christ, as supposed a meer man; so that its a violent perverting of his meaning by the Jesuite <hi>Sandaeus Hydrus Hollandicus,</hi> when he would from this infer, That by <hi>Calvins</hi> principles, the Doctrine of Satisfaction
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118921:61"/> cannot be maintained. Thus virulent also is <hi>Mentzer</hi> the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> from that passage in <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Meisner,</hi> who though otherwise a learned <hi>Lutheran,</hi> from other doctrinal principles of the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> would lay down this conclusion, He that would avoid <hi>Photinianism</hi> must eschew <hi>Calvinism, Anthrop.

                  <p>THe final cause of our Justification is in this Text set down <hi>generally,</hi> and then divided into two particulars, The <hi>finis cujus,</hi> and the <hi>finis cui.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>finis cujus</hi> I shall at this time accomplish; and for the other, <hi>viz. finis cui,</hi> I shall take another Text. <hi>The end for the sake whereof God will justifie us through Christs bloud, as a Satisfactory Atonement, is to declare his Justice and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> that he doth not onely abhorre it, but will punish it, with his severest wrath, and therefore spareth not his Sonne, when he will become Surety for a sinner; That Christ made a true and proper Satisfaction by his bloud to Gods Justice, hath been proved at large.<note place="margin">Why it was necessary we should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed in a way of Justice.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us proceed to shew the grounds of this way, <hi>Why it was necessary that we should be redeemed in a way of Justice, as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118921:62"/> well as of Mercy and Power.</hi> For some decry this as a most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and prophane imagination. Now besides the Scripture Texts, which you have heard plainly declaring Gods will to redeem man in this manner, and no other, we may conceive two grounds of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And the first is, <hi>From the Nature of sinne.</hi> It is of an <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite guilt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">From the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of sin.</note> and hath an <hi>infinite evil</hi> in the nature of it, and therefore no meer creature, but that person who had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite dignity could make Satisfaction for it. Its a Rule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all, That by how much greater and more noble the person is, to whom the offence is made, by so much the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is the greater, as <hi>Jude vers.</hi> 8.9. aggravates some mens sins from the excellency of the object, <hi>They speak evil of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</hi> When <hi>Shimei</hi> cursed <hi>David,</hi> the King and chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Land, it was more hainous then if he had done it to one of the meaner sort. Hence in respect of the object, The crucifying of <hi>Christ</hi> was a crimson sinne, because he was <hi>the Sonne of God, and the Lord of glory;</hi> The death of all the men in the world was not so much as his: Now seeing the majesty and honour of God is infinite, and there is no proportion between a creatures glory, and Gods glory: Therefore every sinne being injurious to this Majesty, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive of his glory, it must have an infinite evil and guilt in it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> dispute, Whether sinne can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to be an infinite evil? Some grant, that in some respect it may be called infinite, because its against an infinite God, whose Majesty is incomprehensible, but this is wholly extrinsecal, for God is not the intrinsecal object of the soul, no not when it enjoyeth him in the most happy manner. Now if this be granted, its enough to us, that seeing sinne hath at least thus farre an infinite demerit in it, because com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against a God of unsearchable Glory and Majesty, therefore none can make compensation or satisfie, but such an one, who hath as much honour and worth in him, as sinne brought dishonour; and this can onely be <hi>God and man,</hi> who though as a man did things <hi>humiliter,</hi> yet as God they were done <hi>sublimiter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:118921:62"/>
                  <p>But there are others that say the evil of sinne is infinite <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally,</hi> because it doth offend God, <hi>in quantum est offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibilis,</hi> as farre as he can be offended; for that sinne doth not actually hurt God, and destroy him, is from his infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: if the sinner by his sinne could effect the ruine of the Divine Majesty, he would. Hence by the <hi>first Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> we are forbidden, <hi>To make to our selves any other gods but him;</hi> Every sinner sets up another God besides him: Now that is to offend God as highly as he can be offended; Every sinner making the object of his sinne another God, provokes God as much as God can be provoked; Those that made <hi>their belly their God,</hi> Phil. 3.19. And <hi>covetousnesse</hi> being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Col. 3.5. as the Poet said,
<q>Clausum arcâ custodit Jovem.</q> These sinners sitting up creatures in the room of God, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him infinitely; so that if a creature could love God <hi>in quantum est amabilis,</hi> that would be infinite love; hence God onely loveth himself; so because sinne is an offence against him, as farre as he can be offended, therefore it may well be said to have an infinite evil and guilt in it. Neither (say the same Authors) will this make every sinne alike, because one infinite cannot be more then another; for although in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the aversion from God, and offence to him, all are alike, and therefore all are punished equally <hi>poenâ damni,</hi> with the losse of God; yet in respect of their conversion or turning to the creature, which is the cause of turning from God, so there is a difference: As (say they) darknesse is in it self a total privation of light, yet as there may be causes impeding this light, so one darknesse may be greater then another: Howsoever these things are, yet to be sure the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture speaks of sinne, as an <hi>offence, rebellion</hi> and <hi>despising of God;</hi> and he being the <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and <hi>fountain</hi> of all good and excellency, sinne doth thereby derive such guilt upon the offender, that unlesse there be a greater good, then all the sins collectively are an evil, there cannot be any true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per satisfaction. And indeed the wisdom of God would not have suffered evil to be, had he not known thereby to procure a greater good.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:118921:63"/>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second main ground, why God doth justifie by way of satisfaction,<note place="margin">From the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> is, <hi>From that glorious property of his Justice, whereby as he hateth sinne, so he doth propend to punish it.</hi> This property we have asserted by many places of Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Socinians</hi> deny it, making Mercy and Justice (or as they call it anger) no properties in God, but meer volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effects of his free will, which being laid down as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, then the superstruction must be, That Christ did not die by way of Satisfaction, at least, there was no necessity of it. But we affirm, That as Mercy, Omnipotency and Wisdom, so Justice also, whereby he enclineth to punish sin, is natural to God.</p>
                  <p>Indeed even amongst the Orthodox, there is difference of Judgements, at least in this point, Whether <hi>primitive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> was so natural to God, supposing sinne to be, that he could not remit it without Satisfaction? But happily by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction or two the difference may be reconciled.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Distinctions of natural ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities. And whether God could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>1. Concerning <hi>Natural,</hi> which <hi>Paraeus Comment. in</hi> 2<seg rend="sup">d</seg>
                     <hi>cap. Gen, &amp; cap</hi> 9. <hi>ad Rom. Dub.</hi> 12. hath out of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> That a thing may be said to be natural two wayes, either, 1. When it necessarily and meerly floweth from the principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; thus the fire burneth naturally, the stone descends na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally. Or secondly, When it floweth from the principles of nature, but by the mediation and intervention of free will. Thus to understand, to will, to laugh, to speak, are natural actions to man, yet so as the exercise of them is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected unto our free will. Thus when we say its natural to God to punish and correct sinne, we mean in the later sense; not as if God must necessarily punish as soon as ever it is committed, or that he must punish to the utmost every time, as natural Agents work to the utmost they can: but the exercise of this, is subject to his wisdome and liberty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When we say God doth necessarily punish sinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is just in his nature, we must distinguish of necessity, 1. There is an absolute and immutable necessity: Thus God only is necessarily, it being impossible that God should not be. 2. There is a limited and respective necessity, and that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118921:63"/> sometimes from the efficient cause, because he is thus or thus disposed; as when it is said, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>There must be heresies,</hi> that is, partly in respect of the efficient cause, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there will be ignorance and pride alwayes in men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Text mentioneth there onely the final cause.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the material cause. Thus death is necessary and inevitable, because we have principles of corruptibility within us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the formal cause, because that is immutable and unchangeable.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From the final cause, supposing such an end. Now its true in the former sense, it was not necessary to have Christs Satisfaction; for it was not absolutely necessary that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde should be redeemed: God might have passed it by, as he did the apostate Angels. Hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. Gods love is ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated, <hi>That he took not the Nature of Angels, but the seed of Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for the later kindes of necessity, some are true here, as there was a necessity of pardoning sinne by Satisfaction, in respect of the efficient cause God, seeing by nature he loaths and hates sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the final cause, seeing he purposed in procuring our Salvation to glorifie his Mercy and Justice, he would not punish all sinne with eternal damnation, nor yet let all go unpunished, but would manifest himself both just and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful; supposing this, it was necessary that sin should not be pardoned without satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A thing may be absolute and necessary, either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <hi>quoad exercitium actus,</hi> in respect of the exercise of the act, or the specification and manner of it; or rather thus, The objects of some properties in God, may be said to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily. Or secondly, The objects supposed, then the acts are necessary. To Gods Omnipotency there is required no object, because it makes its objects: and so to Gods wisdom there is required no qualification in the object, for he can order every thing to a glorious end; but to Gods Mercy and Justice, there are not onely required objects, but objects so qualified either with grace and sinne. Therefore when we
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118921:64"/> say, that it is natural to God to punish sinne, we mean not, as if God must naturally create a world, and procure man to be a sinner, but these things were done by Gods free-will; only suppose man doth fall and become a sinner, then Gods Justice requireth the punishment of it; So that it was free to God whether he would create man or no, yet supposing man is fallen, then its not free whether he will be just in his actions to the sinner or no.</p>
                  <p>These distinctions might clear the point, but because even amongst the Orthodox, there are different assertions in this matter, let us discusse it a little more.</p>
                  <p>There are several learned Authors, that hold Gods Justice in correcting and punishing sinne is so natural, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but punish it, or require Satisfaction, otherwise he should deny himself and his own Nature; and this is not to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from his Omnipotency and Perfection, no more then to say, he cannot lie; but it ariseth from his infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Thus hold many excellent Writers, <hi>Piscator amica Collati. cum Vorst. Lubbertus</hi> 99. <hi>Error. Vorst. Paraeus in cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Genes. &amp; cap.</hi> 9. <hi>ad Rom. Dub.</hi> 12. <hi>Brocheus Animad. in Vorst. Martin. de persona Christi. Steg. Photin. pag.</hi> 506, 507. and many others.</p>
                  <p>There are again others that say, If God be considered ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely in respect of his power, and not upon a supposition of his decree, which is <hi>de facto</hi> to let no sinne go unpunish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but to punish it either in the person or his surety; In this absolute sense they say, God might freely have remitted sin without any Satisfaction, and that there were other wayes of our salvation then by redemption through Christ. <hi>Augustine</hi> several times affirmeth this, especially <hi>Ser.</hi> 3. <hi>de Sanct. Domini,</hi> God saith he, would so repair man, that he would not let sinne go unpunished, because he is just, nor yet let it be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable,</hi> because he is merciful, <hi>Potuit aliter fieri quantum ad potentiam Medici,</hi> &amp;c. If we consider the power of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian, he could have done otherwise: but that place is most notable and urged by all that go this way, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Trin.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. where he saith, Another way of healing our misery, was possible to God, but there was none more convenient
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118921:64"/> then this; Though these places do assert another way possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet they do not determine whether that other way would have been without Satisfaction or not: <hi>Calvin</hi> indeed speaks peremptorily to this purpose, <hi>in cap.</hi> 15. <hi>John v.</hi> 13. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terat vel solo verbo, aut nutu nos redimere,</hi> &amp;c. God might by a meer word or command have redeemed us, but he took this way through his Son, that his love might be made more manifest. And the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> generally following <hi>Lumbard</hi> their Master, and he also following <hi>Augustine</hi> from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned place, do with one consent conclude, God might forgive sinne without any Satisfaction, and that Christs death is necessary onely <hi>hypothetically,</hi> upon a supposition of Gods Decree, to take this way rather then another. Hence <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus</hi> the Jesuite, <hi>(Hydrus Holland)</hi> makes the Catholick truth, as he cals it, to be between the <hi>Socinians</hi> and the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists,</hi> determining, that God will not <hi>de facto</hi> pardon sinne without Satisfaction, against the <hi>Socinians;</hi> yet absolutely he could have done otherwise, against the Protestants. But his <hi>malice</hi> deceiveth him in this, for many Orthodox Protestants, yea and <hi>Calvin</hi> himself acknowledge, God might have redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us by his sole Command or word. And of late the learned Doctor <hi>Twiss</hi> hath a digression on purpose against <hi>Piscator</hi> and <hi>Lubbertus</hi> in this very point, <hi>Vind. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de elect. Digress.</hi> 8. But seeing both <hi>Lubbertus</hi> and D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                     <hi>Twiss</hi> himself do acknowledge that distinction mentioned by <hi>Paraeus</hi> about a two-fold naturality, I see no reason why he should so indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously confute <hi>Lubbertus,</hi> neither do his Arguments seem pressing.</p>
                  <p>For my own thoughts I shall declare them in these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Its agreed on by all hands</hi> (except the <hi>Socinians) that whatsoever God might have done, yet he hath plainly revealed his will, that he will not pardon sin, no not the least sin without a price paid, and an atonement made.</hi> God hath decreed this way and no other, he hath revealed himself to be a God <hi>that will not acquit the guilty,</hi> and that will judge even the least sinnes, though they be but <hi>idle thoughts</hi> and <hi>words:</hi> Seeing therefore God hath pitched upon this way, it seemeth <hi>superfluous</hi> and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118921:65"/> uselesse to dispute about the possibility of another way, and indeed it would be mis-spent time, but that the <hi>Socinians</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily plunge us into it, denying any such Justice of God, as thereby to punish sin, but making it wholly arbitrary to punish or not punish: so that to evidence this truth the more about Gods righteousnesse requiring Christs Satisfaction, we may soberly and modestly enquire into it.</p>
                  <p>Yet in the second place, <hi>What Doctor is there, though never so subtil, angelical or profound, that can positively determine this?</hi> Who knoweth the deep treasuries of Gods power? Who can comprehend his nature? Therefore it becometh ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party of the dissentients to deliver their judgement so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and not to condemn one another, seeing one pretends a zeal to Gods Justice, that it would be derogatory to suffer the contempt of his Majesty without punishing; and the other they declare a zeal to Gods Omnipotency, that he is not to be bounded as men, but having no Superiour above him, may do what he please.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Authors opinion in the point.</note>These 2 things premised, I do incline to that opinion, which holdeth, <hi>That a corrective or vindicative Justice is natural and essential to God, so that he cannot but punish sin, or have satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an atonement by a Surety:</hi> Provided that <hi>natural</hi> be taken in this sense, for that which floweth from nature, yet by the help of free-will and reason; as we say, to laugh, to speak, to will, is natural to a man. And there are these Reasons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderating with me for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, <hi>The Scripture when it speaketh of Gods punishing sinne, doth not attribute it meerly to his Will and Decree, but to his just nature, because he is a righteous God.</hi> Thus <hi>Psal.</hi> 11.7. when the Psalmist had described the judgements of God upon the ungodly, he inferreth it from the righteousnesse of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Because he is a righteous God,</hi> he will thus punish them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15. The judgements which God there executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Churches enemies, are said to be, because he is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God: Seeing therefore that the Scripture when it speaks of the punishing of sin, doth not attribute it meerly to his free-will and power, but because of his just nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hateth sin, and as Judge of the world will be avenged
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:118921:65"/> on it; Therefore we may affirm, such justice as its an attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, is essential to God, though the effects of it, are subject to his free-will, to punish when, where and how he will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>If God punish sinne meerly from his will, then it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> must follow, that sin or no sin is all one to him:</hi> That God in his own nature is not more moved with all the blasphemies and impieties of the world, then if there were none at all; For if God by nature doth not encline to punish sin, but its meer will, then it is no more then when God purposed to create the world, or to make it rain: As it was nothing to Gods nature to make a world, or not make it; to cause it to rain, or not to rain; such an indifferent thing sinne must be to God; But how can this stand with those places, that say, <hi>God is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1? And that, <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day?</hi> And if the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries think it hard to say, That God cannot pardon the least sin without satisfaction, certainly it is more difficult to say, That all the sins of the world may be forgiven, though men never humble themselves, and repent of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>If God punish sin meerly from his will, and not from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> his Nature, How is it that all men have implanted in them such principles about God, that he will punish sin?</hi> Why is it, that upon the committing of any sinne, there is trembling, and a remorse of conscience? Neither can it be said, This is because God by his Word hath revealed he will punish it; for even Heathens and Pagans they have such implantations upon their conscience, they have been able to say, that a wicked man though he may be <hi>securus,</hi> yet he is never <hi>tutus,</hi> that Gods judgement hangs over his head, as a drawn sword. And this the Apostle verifieth of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. <hi>That they know</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>the just judgement of God.</hi> How came they to know this, but from an ingraffed principle of conscience within?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Scripture speaking of damnation, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of sin, attributeth it not only to God ordaining such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but to the merit and desert of sin it self.</hi> Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. they that do such things are said to be <hi>worthy of death;</hi> Why worthy? Or whence doth the desert of hell arise? Is it meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:118921:66"/> because God will? Or not rather, because sinne being a dishonour to God doth deserve it? If then sinne do deserve eternal wrath, then its from Gods justice, not from his meer will that sin is punished.</p>

And certainly, seeing that our Redemption must be by way of Satisfaction, and that requireth a person of infinite dignity, I wonder how any can think any other way was possible, unlesse we may imagine that the Father or the holy Ghost might have been incarnated, for no meer creature could be a Mediator to reconcile God and man; and certainly, seeing that <hi>Austin</hi> himself saith, Though other wayes were possible, yet none is so convenient; this is to give up their cause; for who can tell, whether God could not finde out a more convenient way as well as possible? And if not, then certainly we must conclude, that such is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and perfection of God, that he alwayes takes the most excellent and perfect way. And thus much shall suffice for the clearing of this main Article of Religion.</p>

This is that glorious mystery into which the Angels desire to search, though not so much concerned in it; and shall not the godly man much more study it? For now he hath two tenures to hold his pardon and salvation by, Free grace and Justice; Free grace, in respect of himself; Justice, in respect of Christ. If thou think Free grace will not acquit such a wretch as thou art, then know a full price is laid down to discharge thee of all thy sins: So that now when the Prince of the world comes against thee, thou mayest say in some sense as Christ did, <hi>He can finde nothing in thee,</hi> for how can he accuse
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118921:66"/> thee, seeing Christ is thy Surety? The bond hath been sued upon him, he would not leave one farthing unpaid. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the godly man may live and die without fear, he may well with <hi>Paul</hi> cry out, <hi>Who can lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? Its Christ that died.</hi> This answers Law, Devils, Conscience, Justice, and all. As <hi>Paul</hi> said to <hi>Philemon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Onesimus, If he have wronged thee, or oweth thee any thing, put it on my account:</hi> So doth our Mediator to God, If these owe thee any thing, or have wronged thy Majesty, put it on me. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed added, <hi>I Paul have written it with my own hand,</hi> but Christ hath ratified and confirmed it with his own bloud.</p>

                  <p>The Apostle having in the former part of the Chapter
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118921:67"/> treated of many admirable priviledges Gods children do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy at <hi>vers.</hi> 31. he begins to be overwhelmed in his Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and suffers his spiritual <hi>deliquiums,</hi> as being not able to say any more, <hi>What shall we say to these things?</hi> As if he had said, My soul suffereth violence within me, I cannot go any further. A sea of eloquence is but a drop to this infinite matter; Like the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> seeing the glory of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and beginning to faint within her; thus doth <hi>Paul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the excellent glory God puts on his children, and having after this divine extasie, something recovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he instances in three sad temptations which usually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and pessundate the godly, giving three strong Antidotes and Cordials against them.</p>
                  <p>The first temptation is from the external power and force, which the enemies of Gods Church use to the crushing and breaking of the godly, though Christ will at last break them with <hi>a rod of iron,</hi> yet in the mean time they thus break his people. Now to this, saith <hi>Paul, If God be for us, Who can be against us?</hi> If God be for us, it is not a speech of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but raciocinating; <hi>Si</hi> is for <hi>Quoniam,</hi> seeing God is for us, Who can be against us? Is any greater then God? Is any more powerfull then him? Thou maist well oppose God to all enemies; they have earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power, but I have God; they boast of their Titles and Names, but how glorious are the Titles and Attributes of God?</p>
                  <p>A second temptation is from the want of these necessary, outward comforts. The people of God are sometimes not the <hi>Divesses,</hi> but the <hi>Lazarusses</hi> of the world; Though they have an interest in all promises, yet for the present they may be destitute and wanting all things. To this the Apostle gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a strong Cordial, <hi>If he hath given us his Sonne,</hi> then whom nothing is dearer or more precious, <hi>How shall he not with him give us all things else?</hi> What is food and raiment to Christ?</p>
                  <p>A third temptation, which is the sorest of all, is from <hi>sin,</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> accusing us, the <hi>Devil</hi> charging us, and our <hi>own hearts</hi> and <hi>consciences</hi> condemning us. Now to this, see what
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:118921:68"/> a triumphing challenge he makes, <hi>Who shall lay any thing to Gods elect? Its God that justifieth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that in the words we have a quick and sharp <hi>interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> with a vehement and compleat <hi>responsion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>interrogation</hi> is, <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect?</hi> He doth not say, Who shall condemn them? though he mentioneth that in the next place, <hi>But who shall</hi> so much <hi>as charge them?</hi> draw up a bill and indite them? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men may be accused and indited, and yet not condemned, but here the Apostle doth not only deny the later, but the former also, none can <hi>condemn them,</hi> yea none can <hi>charge them</hi> or accuse them, for the reason is, <hi>It is God that justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> Some of old read this also interrogatively, <hi>Doth God that justifieth them? Doth he lay to their charge?</hi> But it runnes most smoothly without an interrogation.</p>
                  <p>In the words we have the <hi>efficient cause, God;</hi> and the <hi>action</hi> attributed to him, <hi>he justifieth,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

If therefore they have not Gods Name and Authority to warrant them, they are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; if God gives an acquittance or discharge, none dare oppose, for the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>That there is a glorious priviledge vouchsafed to the believer, which the Scripture cals Justification.</hi> This is the very Marrow of Doctrinal and Practical Divinity, and therefore we are to give the more attendance to it. <hi>Luther</hi> said, <hi>Praefat. in Galat.</hi> That this Article of Justification did reign in his heart, that night and day his thoughts did flow and reflow about it. Its the Centre wherein all theological truths do meet. Its the Ocean that by its several streams watereth and refresheth the Paradise, the Church of God. Its the Ark of faith, all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is kept pure, while this is kept pure. Its accounted one instance of the prophetical spirit in <hi>Luther,</hi> that he fore-saw this Doctrine would be after his time greatly obscured; and indeed not onely <hi>Papists,</hi> but all sorts of <hi>Hereticks</hi> have throw a many dead flies in this precious ointment; so that the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:118921:68"/> Doctrine of it being of such vast consequence, it cals for all able learned men to keep this Spring pure: As every wound in the heart is mortal, so every errour about Justification is dangerous: Therefore it is a licentious expression of that <hi>Leviathan, Hobs Deceiver, cap.</hi> 18. who sports himself in all <hi>Political, Ethical</hi> and <hi>Theological matter,</hi> when he saith, The Disputations about justifying faith are meerly Philosophical, and so not essential to Religion; and thus the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> makes it not a straws matter, whether we say, <hi>Fides quae viva,</hi> or <hi>quà viva justificat,</hi> whereas these particulars declare a vast difference; as when we speak of Christ, it would be to say, <hi>Christus qui Deus est moritur,</hi> and <hi>quâ Deus est,</hi> Christ who is God died, and as he is God he died, the former is a truth, the later is blasphemy; and besides this Doctrine is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary practically, how many thousands are ignorant of it, that know not what Justification is, that which they need more then their daily bread: that which they want as much as their breath, even every moment, of this they are wholly unskilful.</p>

                     </gap>, and in all of them, when the word is used in <hi>Hiphil, It signifieth either the absolving or acquitting of one righteous, or the declaration of a mans righteousnesse by some outward testimony.</hi> This being clear in the Scripture, and asserted as the first Proposition, therefore we lay down a second.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>That to justifie in a Scripture sense is to absolve or pronounce a man righteous, not to infuse or put righteousnesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man.</hi> Here is the great contest between the Papists and us; We say the word is taken from Courts of Justice, when a person accused is absolved and so used in a juridical sense; They say it signifieth to make inherently just and righteous, as <hi>calefaction</hi> signifieth to make inherently hot, and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to make inherently holy. Now this is not a vain strife of words, for the great Article of our Religion depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right discovery of the use of the word: If to justifie signifie to give us an inherent righteousnesse, then by that we
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:118921:69"/> may appear before God; in the confidence of that we may live and die; we must still look to something within us; but if to justifie signifie <hi>to acquit us being accused for sinne through the grace of God, and the righteousnesse of Christ,</hi> then we are to go out of our selves to renounce every thing that is ours, we are to look without us, we are with <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3. <hi>Not to be found in our own righteousnesse, but that which is by faith in Christ.</hi> It is the judgement of the Protestants, that the word is constantly used so in the Scripture, and that the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are never yet able to produce any one place to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, insomuch that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself confesseth, this is the most common use of the word. Neither do the Papists onely interpret the word <hi>Justifie</hi> for <hi>Justification,</hi> or making righteous by habitual and actual righteousnesse. But the <hi>Socinians</hi> also, and all their Interpolators. <hi>Castelli de Justif.</hi> doth industriously set himself to prove, that to justifie is to heal a man of his sins by inward sanctification, though he acknowledge the Scripture-use of the word in the sense before-mentioned, neither can he instance in any one place to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>But when we say its a <hi>juridical</hi> word, the meaning is not, as if it were applied only to Judges in their <hi>judicial acts;</hi> for its many times applied to <hi>particular persons</hi> justifying either themselves or others, only we say, when applied to God, it signifieth a <hi>judicial absolution,</hi> for here in this Text, there are <hi>accusations</hi> and <hi>condemnations</hi> supposed, to which <hi>Justification</hi> is opposed; and indeed if to <hi>justifie</hi> were to endow us with holinesse and righteousnesse, then considering how imperfect and weak the best mans graces are, there would be enough to lay to his charge; so that with <hi>Cain</hi> he would be forced to cry out, <hi>My sins are greater then I can bear.</hi> Indeed there is a speech of <hi>Calvins</hi> questioned by <hi>Vorstius, de Justitia Dei,</hi> when he saith, That God in justifying of us, doth <hi>Quodam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo deponere personam judicis;</hi> and the <hi>Arminians</hi> make two distinct, as it were, Thrones of Gods, a <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> and a <hi>Throne of Justice (Lubbert. cont. Bertium;)</hi> and this they do, that so their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>credere</hi> may be accounted of for an universal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse to Justification: but as you heard, and shall be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:118921:70"/> manifested more (God willing) God doth not pronounce any <hi>righteous,</hi> but he that hath a <hi>perfect righteousnesse;</hi> now seeing no godly mans righteousnesse, much lesse faith it self, which is but a particular grace, is all the righteousnesse we ought to have: Therefore we must look out for some more perfect and enduring righteousnesse then this is; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent take notice, that most of the places of Scripture speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Justification,</hi> make it a <hi>discharging</hi> and <hi>acquitting from accusations,</hi> and so doth legally make just, not qualita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.1. <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. And indeed to <hi>justifie</hi> a wicked man could not be an abomination to the Lord, if to justifie were to make just and holy, for this would be acceptable to God.</p>
                  <p>Those two places often instanced in by the Papists, are as often answered by the Orthodox, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>They that are justifiers of many,</hi> or as we render it, <hi>That turn many to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, shall be as the starres,</hi> for the Ministers of the Word do not justifie by infusing holinesse into their teachers, but by informing and instructing of them how to attain to this benefit, and by a declarative application of Gods grace to the humbled, repenting sinner, in which sense they are said to <hi>remit</hi> and <hi>loose</hi> sinne, which is to <hi>justifie instrumentally,</hi> even as they are said to <hi>regenerate,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.13. and <hi>save,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.16. instrumentally.</p>
                  <p>The other place is <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.11. <hi>He that is righteous, let him be righteous,</hi> or justified still. Some Divines will indeed grant, that Justification taken largely and improperly, may comprehend under it Sanctification also, for God never <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth,</hi> but those he <hi>sanctifieth,</hi> yet there is no necessity to understand it so here, seeing it may only denote, that he who is righteous should abide and continue in the state of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>For though holy works do not justifie, yet by them a man is continued in a state and condition of Justification: so that did not the Covenant of Grace interpose, grosse and wicked wayes would cut off our Justification, and put us in a state of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> Let this then be concluded on, That Justification is a legal or juridical word; so that if men guilty of crimes, especially capital, tremble at those Summons which bring them
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118921:70"/> before the Judge, How much more should we at those sins for which we shall be arraigned at Gods barre? So that if God did not mercifully absolve us through Christ, we must necessarily undergo that eternal doom, which is due unto our sins.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Justification being thus an absolution of us, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> pronouncing of us righteous, there is necessarily implied thereby, that we are indeed made and constituted righteous;</hi> For seeing God pronounceth a <hi>curse</hi> against him <hi>that justifieth the wicked,</hi> we cannot or must not think, that because God is said to <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 4. that God doth that which he abhorreth in us; for though the person justified be in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a sinner, yet at the same time believing in Christ, and putting Christs righteousnesse upon him, he is made a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of a perfect righteousnesse, by which he is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>By one mans obedience shall many be made righteous,</hi> where by obedience is not meant one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Christs death,</hi> but his <hi>active conformity to the Law of God,</hi> neither is that expression to be understood of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteousnesse, as is more largely to be shewed: God then when he pronounceth us righteous, judgeth according to truth; So that in this we need not contest with the Papist, Whether it signifie to make righteous or no, onely we deny it to make righteous inherently, we are truly and really made righteous, but not by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect renovation of the whole man in a full conformity to Gods will. This if duely considered must revive the heart of every true believer: He thinketh, How shall I come with my rags into the presence of so glorious and holy a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty? How shall I so full of sin and imperfection, come into Gods presence? Is it not as offensive, as it was for those croak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frogs to creep into <hi>Pharaohs</hi> chamber? Oh remember that thou art a just and righteous man, not in thy self, but in Christ, in whom is no blemish! When God beholds his Church in Christ, then he saith, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. <hi>Thou art all fair, my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, there is no spot in thee;</hi> yet this doth not degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into that <hi>Antinomian</hi> position, <hi>That God seeth no sinne in his people, nor doth chastise them for it,</hi> as is to be shewed.</p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:118921:71"/>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, <hi>Seeing that to justifie is to constitute, and to declare or pronounce righteous; therefore in the third place, it signifieth to attribute all those testimonies either real or verbal to a person so justified, as if he were inherently and compleatly righteous.</hi> Thus when God is said to be justified, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. that is, because he is indeed just and righteous, to acknowledge this in the world, so to speak of him, and so to celebrate all his providences, as one that doth dispense every thing with much wisdom and purity. Thus <hi>wisdome</hi> is said <hi>to be justified of her children,</hi> Matth. 11.19. Although learned men much differ about the sense of that place, and give contrary Interpretations, Some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the word to signifie reproved and condemned, because Christ was disallowed by the Jews, as the Greek word is used sometime in humane Authours: Howsoever, when a person is made righteous, and so pronounced, then whatsoever promises and priviledges are appointed for righteous persons, he may claim and expect: hence the effects of such a Justification, are such, that none can have but righteous persons, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>Being justified we have peace with God;</hi> and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. <hi>We may come boldly to the throne of grace.</hi> There is none <hi>can lay any thing to our charge:</hi> What can be said more of Angels and Saints in Heaven? None can blame them, accuse or condemn them, and this justified persons have in this life; Oh the depth, breadth and length of this glorious mercy! Now the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, though compassed about with many infirmities, may as boldly walk abroad, and be afraid or ashamed of no nakednesse, no more then <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall: Though it is not upon his doing the Law that he liveth, yet it is upon Christs fulfilling of it: When <hi>Joseph</hi> is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged out of prison, then he feareth no more arrests, yea he is preferred to the greatest glory and honour that can be in the Court: Why is it that men leave not the thoughts of all other things to be instated in this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Did they so much esteem a freedome in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Rome?</hi> How much more ought we to be of that <hi>City in Heaven?</hi> for there neither Law, or Conscience, or
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:118921:71"/> Devils have any thing to do with us, we are no more under their dominion.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Justification in the Gospel-way doth alwayes suppose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> some accusation, some charge, and therefore he must have been a sinner that is thus justified.</hi> Indeed the Apostle speaks of a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by works,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. <hi>The doers of the Law shall be justified;</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. There he argueth against such a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi> but this is only a <hi>supposed and imagined one;</hi> The presumptuous Jew being confident in his own righteousnesse thought to introduce such an one: for now since man fallen all the Justification that is, proceedeth by pardoning our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and imputing Christs righteousnesse unto us. Hence <hi>Adam</hi> if he had continued would have been justified, and so the confirmed Angels are, but not in that notion or way as the Scripture-justification is declared to be: for <hi>Adam</hi> and the elect Angels, have no matter or desert of accusation, there was not the least blemish in their natures; Therefore our Justification differs <hi>specifically</hi> from them; yea our <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> before God, differs much from a <hi>judicial absolution</hi> in the <hi>Courts of men,</hi> for with them the more faults are pardoned, the lesse is he justified; yea a man that is pardoned is not said to be justified, but when crimes are charged upon him, and he proveth himself not guilty, then is the Judge said to justifie him. But it is not thus in Gods Court, for there the sinner is arraigned and found guilty, it is too plain he hath transgressed this and that command, he cannot hide it, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it: Now then, God by looking upon us through <hi>Christ,</hi> who made himself an <hi>atonement</hi> for our sins, doth absolve and pronounce us <hi>just:</hi> Oh then that believers did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Gods way better! There is nothing more innate and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to man, then to be his own self-justifier, still to think, that for the goodnesse of his heart, and the holinesse of his works, he shall be accepted of. The Jews <hi>Rom</hi> 9.1. whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Paul</hi> said, yet would <hi>go about to establish their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</hi> Men may sooner be convinced to part with their sins, then with their seeming righteousnesse in matter of <hi>Justification;</hi> What was it that made <hi>Luther</hi> lie in a very hell so long, that he often wished he had never been a man,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118921:72"/> the terrours of sinne were so great upon him? But because he was ignorant of Gods way in justifying. Till a man be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly <hi>Evangelized,</hi> he cannot but think, he must go with his full works to God that he may be justified, and till he hath them, he must excruciate and torment himself, as being under daily fears and bondage; so that its one of the difficultest lessons, and that which Christs Scholars in his highest form do only learn, to go out of their holinesse and duties by faith to Christ for righteousnesse, as well as by conversion to turn from their sins to God. Indeed men corrupted in their opinions judge otherwise, as <hi>Castellio lib. de Justic.</hi> he makes this rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on anothers righteousnesse, <hi>viz.</hi> Christs, to be a sweet pleasing thing to flesh and bloud, as if men had rather do this then mortifie any one sin; but as the Sun can never be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light; so neither can this righteousnesse be with out true holinesse: So that although many mens mouths are like open sepulchres against this way of Justification, yet it being so clearly discovered in the Scripture, and the Saints recorded to tremble at their own righteousnesse, <hi>lest God should enter into judgement with them</hi> because of it; Therefore all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are to look on this, as the Anchor of their souls, as the only City of Refuge, as that they only can live with and die with, without which what was said of <hi>Judas</hi> might be true of every one, <hi>It had been better he had never been born.</hi>

                  <p>SOme Propositions have been already delivered for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this necessary and precious Doctrine of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which we are to say, as God of the Land of <hi>Israel, Our eyes and our hearts are to be upon it all the day long.</hi> We shall at this present add more. And</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Though Justification be not an infusing of such holinesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> and righteousnesse into us, that thereby we are justified, yet this Justification is never without a Sanctification of our natures:</hi> So that this Doctrine gives no just ground for those prophane calumnies <hi>Papists</hi> and others make, as if we held that men, though wallowing in sinne, were justified by God, as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christs righteousnesse was imputed to them, there needed no other holinesse at all. Hence do they so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride this righteousnesse as <hi>putative;</hi> yea <hi>Castalia (lib. de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stif.)</hi> mocketh the Orthodox with their putative modesty and putative learning, but this is an impudent slander; for we professe over and over again, That inherent righteousnesse, and imputed are inseparably annexed, neither is the Question, Whether God doth renew us by his Spirit, and sanctifie our natures when he justifieth us? But <hi>Whether this be our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</hi> Even the Papists themselves acknowledge, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this Justification and infused righteousnesse they speak of, there is requisite also remission of sinnes, or a judicial ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, only they make this either <hi>previous</hi> or <hi>concomitant,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:118921:73"/> or <hi>subsequent</hi> to our Justification. This then is confessed on all sides, That an inherent godlinesse and holinesse every ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified person hath; But the Question is, Whether for this within him he be justified, or for something without him? We say, The righteousnesse of the most eminent person that is, cannot stand in Gods sight, neither can the just God who pronounceth of things as they are, declare that to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteousnesse which is not. Now its plain, That all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men finde and feel imperfections in their most holy things: One would think that one passage, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143.2. is enough to satisfie all, where <hi>David,</hi> though a man after Gods own heart, yet prayeth, <hi>That God would not enter into judgement with him, because in his sight no man living can be justified.</hi> He doth not say, he himself, but no man living; for, saith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, Vidit totam vitam humanam circumlatrari peccatis suis,</hi> upon <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. If thou markest our iniquities, O Lord, who should stand? Our imperfections and sins are like so many dogs barking about us that we cannot stirre this foot or that foot, but one sinne or other doth immediately open the mouth against us. Though therefore we are possessed of inherent righteousnesse, yet we rest not, or put confidence in this. This <hi>Contarenus</hi> an ingenuous Papist of old, acknowledged say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>We had no righteousnesse on which we might rest,</hi> niti tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam re stabili, <hi>but only the righteousnesse of Christ.</hi> But of this more in time.</p>

                     <hi>Propos.</hi> 2. <hi>As the Scripture speaks of a two-fold righteousnesse and a two-fold rule and covenant: So there is also a two-fold Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</hi> There is a <hi>righteousnesse of the Law</hi> which is <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal compleat</hi> and <hi>final,</hi> whereby a man is pronounced by God just in himself, and for his works sake; so that its not of free grace, but debt, that he is so accepted of; and there is <hi>a righteousnesse of faith,</hi> or <hi>covenant of grace,</hi> whereby a sinner believing is pronounced righteous, not in himself, but through Christ his Surety, and thereby Salvation is wholly of grace to him. The former kinde of Justification is now a meer <hi>non ens,</hi> there is no such thing but in books, no man living is justified thus inherently and subjectively, and therefore the Apostle in those two Epistles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:118921:73"/> where Justification is professedly and exactly treated of, doth very powerfully and fervently set himself against that legal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, which some corrupt teachers endeavoured to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. Now its a very necessary point even for every Christian to know this distinction, for there are but these two ways of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation possible, the one would have been of <hi>Adam</hi> had he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in holinesse, then his Justification would not have been a judicial acquittance by remission of sin, but an accounting of him just for his inherent and acquired righteousnesse. But this way of Justification is impossible for man fallen, and yet the heart of man is very prone to this way, as appears by the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who laboured <hi>to establish their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse;</hi> and by the false Apostles even in the very first age of the Church, you reade, nothing troubled the Church more, then what that was by which we stood justified before God: The false teachers boldly affirming, That it was by the Law, and the righteousness thereof, and by the works we do; <hi>Paul</hi> on the other side zealously opposeth, informing, That our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is in pardon of sin and imputation of righteousness, and that no kinde of works, no not of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, do justifie us: If therefore thou art able to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between these two kinde of Justifications, blesse God for this knowledge, and get the spiritual improvement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for they are immediately contrary, and therefore no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can be justified both these wayes; if it be by works of the Law, then not of faith; if it be by inherency, then not by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Indeed <hi>the righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in us,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. but not by us, we are justified by the righteousness of the Law in Christ our Surety, he satisfied that, but because we were not performers of it in our own persons, therefore its wholly of grace to us, because its alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without us: Insomuch that some Divines say, We have our Justification and Salvation, by a <hi>Do this and live,</hi> but not in our own persons, but through Christ our Mediator, who did the Law for us. Therefore though our works be every where excluded from Justification under any notion whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, yet Christs works are necessarily included: As these two Justifications are directly contrary, so there is no way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
<pb facs="tcp:118921:74"/> them together by confusion or mixtion, they being <hi>two kindes</hi> consisting in indivisible, and therefore you cannot by any distinction so unite them that a third way of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be produced; and this is especially to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for that hath been the endeavour of many later writers, to make a compound of Justification of faith and works toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to make a mixt thing of these two; That whereas the Apostle doth make them immediately contrary, <hi>If of works, then not of faith,</hi> and the believer and the works are alwayes opposed as incompatible, and without this immediate oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, the Apostles arguments would fall to the ground, they will <hi>Dare tertium,</hi> and finde out some expedient to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile those things which the Apostle makes so extreamly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant. As the Papist, We are not justified by works, that is, say they, as opposed to Christs death, and his Spirit, but if they be the works of grace, and the Spirit of God, if <hi>tincta sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Christi,</hi> then so we are justified. The <hi>Socinians</hi> and others say, though upon different principles, We are not justified by the workes of the Law, but by the works of the Gospel, or by works in an Evangelical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, so that they be not judged meritorious, or that they obtain Salvation by way of debt, but as conditions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Gospel, thus they and faith justifie. But all this mincing and palliating will not hold; The Apostle gives no <hi>medium</hi> between believing and working, all kinde of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>quà</hi> working, is immediately opposed to believing; so that <hi>faith</hi> as it is a work is excluded from our Justification. But of this more in time, its enough for the present that we are to apprehend these two kinds of Justification as immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>contrary,</hi> and by no subtil distinctions in the world can be united together.</p>

                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. That we may understand all the essentials ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to this glorious priviledge of our Justification, we may take this large and popular description of it, <hi>Justification is a gracious and just act of God, whereby through Christ our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Surety, a sinner but repenting and believing is pronounced just, and hereby put into a state of reconciliation and favour with God, to the praise of Gods glorious Attributes, and to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb facs="tcp:118921:74"/> eternal Salvation.</hi> I shall not examine this description by accurate logical rules, its enough that it is comprehensive of every thing requisite to the knowledge of Justification. And</p>
                  <p>First, We call it an <hi>action,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iustification an action.</note> for so God as a just and merciful Judge is considered in this matter, pronouncing of such as are free from all curses, and also just and righteous. Justification is not properly the sentence or judgement whereby we are pronounced righteous, but its Gods action: Now whether it be an <hi>immanent action,</hi> and so from all <hi>eternity,</hi> or <hi>transient,</hi> accomplished in <hi>time,</hi> I have elsewhere discussed <hi>(Treatise of Justif.)</hi> and there concluded, <hi>That its not immanent nor from eternity, but passing upon a believer in time.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iustification not an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent but a transient.</note> Indeed the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men darken the dispute about <hi>immanent</hi> and <hi>transient actions,</hi> that its hard to say from them, what is either so or so; for who would not without al doubt conclude, that the Creation of the world is a <hi>transient action,</hi> and yet they hotly quarrel about that, some affirming, and some denying at least in some sense.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore lay aside the distinction of <hi>immanent</hi> and <hi>transient,</hi> and plainly say, <hi>God doth not from eternity justifie us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Its an action of God.</note>
                     <hi>no more then sanctifie or glorifie, but when a man believeth, then, and not before is he justified,</hi> as I have at large proved in the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned place. Its an <hi>action of God,</hi> therefore in the Text its said, <hi>God doth justifie,</hi> for seeing that sinne is onely committed against him, and its an offence to his Majesty, and a transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Law; therefore the Scripture attributeth it to <hi>God</hi> only; and indeed though all the men in the world, and our own consciences do acquit us, yet while God doth not justifie we remain unavoidably miserable. Now when we say, <hi>God ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth,</hi> that is to be understood of the <hi>three Persons in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;</hi> the <hi>Father justifieth,</hi> and the <hi>Son justifieth,</hi> so doth the <hi>holy Ghost.</hi> Though the Scripture observeth the peculiar <hi>oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> and order, and therefore Justification is attributed to the <hi>Father,</hi> and the merit of it to the <hi>Son,</hi> and the application of it to the <hi>holy Ghost.</hi> The <hi>Socinians,</hi> they say, <hi>Christ justifieth only instrumentally, not principally, even as faith is said to save.</hi> Socin. <hi>apud Steg. p.</hi> 510. but this cannot be, because Christ is God as well as man, and therefore cannot be instrumental, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal. Hence <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. it is said, <hi>Christ</hi> even as Gods <hi>righteous
<pb facs="tcp:118921:75"/> servant,</hi> which is in respect of his <hi>Mediatory Office should justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie many.</hi> Again <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>first Adam</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and opposed, as the two heads, one of <hi>condemnation;</hi> the other of <hi>Justification to life;</hi> so that as <hi>Adam</hi> was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal in reference to <hi>death</hi> and <hi>judgement,</hi> so <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of <hi>life and righteousnesse.</hi> Furthermore, <hi>Christ is the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and efficient cause of all organical and instrumental causes in our Justification,</hi> as <hi>faith,</hi> which is <hi>mans instrument,</hi> Christ is the cause of it, <hi>Luk</hi> 17.5. So Christ is the cause of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,</hi> and the spiritual success of it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. And hence it is that he is called, <hi>The Sun of righteousness,</hi> Mal. 5.2. <hi>The true light,</hi> Joh. 1.9. <hi>The King of righteousness,</hi> Heb. 7.2. All which comparisons do plainly demonstrate, That Christ is <hi>principal,</hi> and not <hi>instrumental.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

So that as against the former <hi>heresie,</hi> we say, God did not pardon sin, as some great Kings of the world use to do at the instant Petition of some Favourite; so neither against the <hi>later errour</hi> do we say, That Christ by his death hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that half the debt should be accounted as the whole, or whereas the debt was to be paid in gold, it should now suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice if it be paid in lead, or some other baser metal.</p>
                  <p>The next thing in the description is <hi>a sinner repenting and believing;</hi> a sinner,<note place="margin">A sinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and believing.</note> therefore he that is perfectly righteous cannot be partaker of an <hi>Evangelical Justification;</hi> This should inform the godly, that they are not with diffidence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust to be cast down, when they feel the reliques of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption still moving in them; whensoever they assay to go, they finde some pain and stiffnesse, much unbelief, pride, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worldly cares do hinder and trouble them: Oh refresh thy self with the nature of this Justification! If thou wert not a sinner thou didst not need a Justification, if thou wert not undone in thy self, thou didst not want a Saviour, if there were no corruption in thee, there would be no need of a Christ. Thus the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>He justifieth the ungodly;</hi> now this Justification doth not only reach to <hi>sins against the Law,</hi> but <hi>against the Gospel;</hi> it sounds as intolerable Doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:118921:76"/> in my ears, That Christ our Mediator did only expiate by his death sins against the Law and Covenant of works, but that those that are against the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> even our faith as justifying and repentance, which are not duties known by the Law, or consistent with it, have their imperfections in them, and do deserve eternal damnation, and therefore our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor stands obliged by his office, to atone for the sins that are in the second Covenant as well as in the first.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A sinner but repenting.</note>In the description of the object, we adde, <hi>a sinner, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,</hi> and this is to exclude all <hi>Antinomian poison,</hi> as if a person abiding in his sins, and while persisting in his rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were partaker of this glorious priviledge: this cannot be, because remission of sin, which is a great part of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is alwayes by the Scripture promised to such as <hi>humble themselves, and repent of their iniquities,</hi> till there be humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is no forgivenesse, as I have in the former Treatise at large proved. Therefore that is a foul slander of <hi>Grotius</hi> against the <hi>Orthodox (Voto pacis pag.</hi> 115.) that with us, it were enough to say to the most wretched sinner that liveth, Do but believe this, <hi>that thy sins are forgiven,</hi> and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more required to thy salvation, <hi>cum haec viatico evolat in Coelum:</hi> With what fore-head could he charge this upon the Protestant Doctrine, who had read many of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings? But there cannot come honey from a <hi>Serpent.</hi> We say, there is no aptitude or fitnesse, yea there is an absolute contrariety in a sinner to Justification, till he do repent. But repenting is not all, it must be a <hi>sinner repenting and believing.</hi> This corrective must be to our repentance, else our tears will be of the fountain <hi>Marah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Believing:</note> only this you must diligently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto, that <hi>repentance</hi> is not an ingredient to our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>faith</hi> is, <hi>Repentance qualifieth the subject, but faith imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately receiveth it.</hi> Repentance is not an instrument receiving Christ, as faith doth. Its not therefore a justifying repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as we call it a justifying faith: Hence the Scripture useth a peculiar appropriated expression of faith, <hi>Justified by faith,</hi> and remission of sins is <hi>received by faith in his bloud,</hi> which is never attributed to any other grace. Therefore that is unsound doctrine which excludeth faith from a peculiar
<pb facs="tcp:118921:76"/> instrumentality in our Justification, making faith and obe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be the conditions of our Justification, and that they do both alike justifie, only faith is granted to have some kinde of principality: But this is directly to be confuted, when we come to shew negatively, <hi>What is not that righteousnesse by which we stand justified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the description followeth the very formal and essential nature, wherein this Justification doth consist,<note place="margin">Is pronounced just.</note> and that is in <hi>pronouncing Just.</hi> Now this doth contain in it two things, <hi>Remission of sins,</hi> and <hi>Imputation of Christs righteousnesse.</hi> Its true in this later, There is great dispute amongst the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> some denying wholly the imputed obedience of Christ, as actively considered: But that is in its due place to be largely maintained, neither may we, if we attend to Scripture, or to the nature of Justification, think that it is wholly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in pardon of sin; I have at large in my former Treatise discussed <hi>the nature of the pardon of sin.</hi> Its my main scope in this Book to handle the doctrine of <hi>imputed righteousnesse,</hi> of which fully, as my method proposed, will conduct me to it. The consequent of this Justification followeth in the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, That hereby the person justified is <hi>instated into Gods favour.</hi> Some make reconciliation an <hi>antecedent,</hi> some a <hi>part</hi> of Justification, but it seemeth more properly to be the <hi>effect</hi> of it; for when once justified, then the great gulf between God and us is removed; Then when God and man are agreed, they may walk together, and we have fellowship with him, and this is not to be conceived in the way of some <hi>transient actions that passe away,</hi> and leave not so much as a <hi>relative change.</hi> No, for when God doth justifie us at first, we are upon our believing put into a <hi>state and a fixed condition of peace with God.</hi> Thus the Scripture speaks of it as a state, like that of Sanctification and Glorification; so that while we are <hi>sleeping</hi> we are justified, because put into that estate, although we do not then actually believe. The <hi>first act</hi> therefore of <hi>faith</hi> receiving Christ in whom we are justified, is like the putting of one into a <hi>state of marriage,</hi> or of <hi>Magistracy:</hi> Though the first act passe away, yet the <hi>relative change</hi> it hath made continueth alwayes; We are not justified by the <hi>habit
<pb facs="tcp:118921:77"/> of faith,</hi> but by the <hi>act,</hi> and yet after the first act we stand justified, though we are not all the day long actually believing. Its true, many learned Divines say, Justification is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed action, and it may be granted in this sense, that God doth daily justifie believers, even as he constantly preserveth them in their natural being; but it is not true in this sense, as if we were put into a new state of Justification every day. This is not only to make a first and a second Justification, but a thousand Justifications; remission of sins and imputation of Christs righteousnesse are reiterated; but Justification besides these doth connote a fixed estate of the justified person, which is but once, and the Mediator of the Covenant of grace doth so firmly uphold this priviledge, that there shall never be any <hi>total intercision of it,</hi> neither do ever any <hi>plenarily apostatize</hi> from this wonderful favour, that once received it. Lastly, There is the end of this Justification, which is two-fold, on Gods part, and on the believers part. On Gods part it is, <hi>That the glorious Attributes of God,</hi> especially his Wisdome, Grace and Justice may be magnified; and certainly all these are more seen in the Justification of a sinner, then in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the world, or in the most eminent mercies and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances the Church ever had: And on the believers part, it is for his infinite comfort here, and his eternal happinesse hereafter: So that our Justification is the beginning of heaven here upon the earth; we can have no more right to heaven hereafter, then Justification doth for the present entitle us unto, only we shall have a full possession, which as yet we want. No wonder then if <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Being justified by faith we have peace with God, yea and glory in tribulations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing with joy unspeakable.</hi>

Its all the comfort, and all the hope he hath, if that go all goeth: So that the excellency and necessity of the point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so great, I shall not withhold any thing that may serve for the clear discovery of it. I shall therefore adde more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions to the former. And</p>
                  <p>The first is, <hi>That though Justification be properly attributed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> to a sinner believing, yet the Scripture speaks of Christs Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not as if Christ repented for us, or believed for us, as some have absurdly affirmed.</hi> Saltmarsh. For as Christ had no personal sinne, so neither could he have such a personal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or justifying faith. Besides, by this Assertion
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118921:78"/> Christ should have relied upon himself, as a Mediatour, and so have been justified by faith in his own bloud. But the Scripture speaks of Christs Justification to another purpose, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. where its called a <hi>great mystery, God manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit;</hi> yea this expression in the Text, <hi>Its God that justifieth,</hi> seemeth to be taken from <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.8. <hi>He is near that justifieth me, who will contend with me?</hi> So that what is there said of Christ, the Apostle doth apply to every believer. Now there are learned men speak of Christs Justification two wayes: Some say, That as Christ took our sins upon him, and so was under Gods displeasure, bearing the wrath due unto us;<note place="margin">Whether Christ was or did need to be justified.</note> so likewise it was necessary he should have a Justification, not for any sinne of his own, but as a common person, and our Surety and Head: Insomuch that Christ upon his Resurrection (they say) having consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the work of our Redemption, was then justified by the Father, and absolved from all the sins of the elect, which were charged upon him; and thus they grant a <hi>virtual Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> in Christ, as we are said to be <hi>risen with him, and to sit in heavenly places with him,</hi> before there be an actual Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith; and this they make the reason, why that which the Prophet spake of Christ, the Apostle applieth to every believer, because Christ is the common person, they are looked upon in him, and none may accuse them, but he must accuse Christ first; but the Scripture seemeth not to be clear for this,<note place="margin">Reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</note> unlesse we mean that Christ merited our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and so we were virtually justified in him, because he obtained the right of our Justification, which was in time to be applied to us: Neither is there any ground to fasten such a Justification upon Christ, because our sins were not so laid upon him, or imputed to him, as to denominate him a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Its true, his righteousnesse is made over to us, so as that thereby we are constituted and accounted of as righteous, but our sins are not in the same manner laid upon him; and the reason of this difference is, because our sins were <hi>imputed to him,</hi> for him <hi>to bear away,</hi> to take away the guilt of them, they were <hi>not to abide on him.</hi> But Christs righteousnesse is made ours, to abide and continue ours, and therefore we
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:118921:78"/> are denominated righteous, but not Christ a sinner, though its true in a large sense. <hi>Luther</hi> said, <hi>Christ was the greatest of all sinners,</hi> but his meaning not his words must be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If therefore there was not such an imputation of sinne unto Christ, as our Surety, in the sense mentioned, then there needed not such a justification of him, as a common person. And as for that Text, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Justified in the Spirit,</hi> by the Spirit, is meant, as most Divines acknowledge, the Divine Nature of Christ, whereby he raised up himself, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. he is said to have <hi>offered up himself by the eternal Spirit,</hi> which was his Divine Nature; so that he was justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by raising up himself; that whereas his enemies had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him for an impostor, for a false prophet, for one that wrought by the devil, and therefore justly suffered such an ignominious end, now he being raised again by his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he was justified against all those calumnies that were cast on him, and this seemeth to be the most genuine exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propos.</hi> 2. <hi>This Justification of the believer extends as farre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> as his accusation and condemnation might have reached.</hi>

                        </gap> and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> I make Justification to oppose both accusation and condemnation, not mattering <hi>Stapletons</hi> cavil on this Text, quarrelling with <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> because its opposed onely to accusation, and that in the next verse Christs death is opposed to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, for one is but the antecedent, the other the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, and Justification taking away the former, must needs remove the later; wheresoever then any accusation may be made against a sinner believing, there we are to conceive our Justification freeing of us. Now our accusation may arise se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>There is the Justice of God accusing and arraigning of us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Accusations.</note>
                     <hi>because we have not in the least manner perfectly observed his Law.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. From God.</note> Therefore that cals for the due punishment belonging to us; for to every sinner we may say the clean contrary in the Text, before he doth believe, Who shall say any thing to free or excuse him that is ungodly? Its God that accuseth and its God that condemneth. Our Justification therefore in the first place doth absolve us from all that God the Judge
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:118921:79"/> of the world hath against us. Hence Justification doth still respect to Gods sight, and to Gods account, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>In thy sight shall no man living be justified.</hi> The world may justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us, our own hearts may absolve us, but God who is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then our hearts, he may condemn us. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justified, we have peace with God;</hi> so that the primary and chief thing in Justification, is to remove that enmity between God and us; we were <hi>stubble</hi> and he a <hi>consuming fire;</hi> we were <hi>darknesse,</hi> and he <hi>light:</hi> Now by Justification all this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and distance is taken away; this then is the original and source of all happinesse, our reconciliation begins with God first: As the waters of the Sea can never lie still while the windes blow upon them; so the heart of man can never have any true quietnesse, while God doth frown on him. <hi>If the anger of a King be like the roaring of a Lion,</hi> how dreadfull is the anger of God? The sense of this made <hi>David</hi> so often pray for the <hi>light of Gods countenance,</hi> as without which no kingdoms, no successe or earthly greatnesse can make him happy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. From the Law</note>In the second place; <hi>The Law, that doth accuse him for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is every one that fulfilleth not that to every iota.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> at large sheweth, there cannot come any Justification by the Law; there is nothing but a curse and execration by that. Therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. though of it self it were appointed for life, yet accidentally through our corruption it is made a <hi>killing</hi> and a <hi>damning Law;</hi> sinne hath a sharp and bitter sting, but its the Law that puts this into it. Now when we are justified, the Scriptures in many places deny us to be under the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. Not that they are exempted from the regulating power of the Law, God himself cannot free them from obedience to that, no more then he can make them not to be his servants or creatures, or then he can deny himself the just titles and rights which belong to him, as God, but only from the maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and curse of the Law; The Law cannot now implead us for the breach of it, because we are found in the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ, <hi>The impossibility of the Law</hi> as to us, <hi>is fulfilled in Christ,</hi> our Justification then freeth us in this Court.</p>

Many may be justified, and yet not think so, or know so. Justification and the certain perswasion of it are separable; we see <hi>David,</hi> though a <hi>childe of light,</hi> yet walking some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in <hi>darknesse.</hi> Therefore our Justification doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in our apprehension of it, for that doth necessarily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it to <hi>antecede,</hi> and the act doth follow the object, except when its causative and constitutive of it. But it is not so here,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:118921:80"/> our Justification is received by faith, but then the reflex act, or the souls knowledge, that it is justified, followeth after, and that differently; in some it followeth immediately, in others its detained a long while; yea a godly man, though greatly in the favour of God, may (for ought I know) live and die in the sense of the want of it; for the perswasion and inward sense of our Justification is not essential to Salvation; neither doth the Scripture require it as a necessary ingredient to our happinesse. Indeed to believe is necessary to Justification and Salvation, but to know, or to be assured that we do believe, is not. But though our Justification doth not necessarily and inseparably cause such peace and consolation in the soul, yet in its nature it doth encline to it: As the Sunne doth to cast its beams abroad, though an eclipse may obstruct and hinder it: and no wonder these emanations of Justification may be intercepted, since in Christ himself, who was truly God, the sense of consolation was for a while stopped, and did not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it self from the Divine Nature to the humane. That Spirit of God spoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. which is sent forth in our hearts, <hi>whereby we cry Abba, Father,</hi> is not in the act of our Justification, but consequent upon it, for God must be our Father, and reconciled with us before we can call him Father. By all this it appears, that our Justification is not only <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> but <hi>in foro conscientiae</hi> also; and indeed our consolation floweth from the later. Though God justifieth us, yet till we feel and know this, we may walk as uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, as if not justified at all. <hi>Mary Magda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

                     <note place="margin">5. From men.</note>5. <hi>Our Iustification doth extend even to all those accusations that we have from Men.</hi> Great are the calumnies that are laid upon the godly, as hypocrites, deceivers, and the worst of men. Now when God justifieth, he cancelleth all these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations. <hi>Grotius</hi> on the Text, following the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> speaks as if the accusation and condemnation here spoken of, to which Justification is opposed, did consist in this only: for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:118921:80"/> he mentioneth no other, Who shall accuse and lay any thing to their charge, when God justifieth? But though this be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, yet its the least considerable in our Justification. Therefore when the children of God are slandered, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and men speak all manner of evil of them without cause; they may comfort themselves from their Justification, God layeth no such thing to their charge, God looks not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as thus and thus, but they are through Christ accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and beloved. Thus you see that Justification doth reach as far as our accusation. Its not a covering too narrow for all thy nakednesse, Christs robes will hide thee when sig leaves cannot.</p>
                  <p>Its asserted, That Justification call'd <hi>in titulo,</hi> or virtual,<note place="margin">Whether Gods act of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be only his grant of it in the Gospel.</note> is nothing but the grant of it in the Gospel; but I see not how that can be called our Justification, its the sign or instrument de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of it, not Justification it self, as the grant or promise of our Sanctification is not our Sanctification; and as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary our condemnation while we abide in sin, or Gods anger against the sinner is not the threatning promulged, but that which comes from God himself; neither then could we say, that we are justified by Christ given unto us, but by the Proposition laid down in the Scripture, whereas all say, that the <hi>objectum quod</hi> of our faith is <hi>ens incomplexum,</hi> not the promise of Christ, but Christ himself promised. Besides <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified, and he is made the patern of all that shall be justified, yet there was no Scripture grant, or deed of gift in writing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring this; God then communicating himself to beleevers in an immediate manner; Therefore to call this grant or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional promise in the Scripture <hi>[Whosoever shall believe shall be justified]</hi> a transient act of God, is very unproper, unlesse in such a sense, as we say, Such a mans writing is his hand, and that is wholly impertinent to our purpose.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This Iustification of us is not necessary at first onely, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> while we are coming out of our sinne, but in the whole progresse of our Sanctification.</hi> Its true, some Divines say, that Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is compleated and <hi>perfected at one instant,</hi> when we <hi>first believed.</hi> Others, they say, its a <hi>continued action,</hi> and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily both may be reconciled: for take Justification as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:118921:81"/> a <hi>state</hi> we are put into, so its not iterated, but done once; neither are we put again and again, or daily in the state of Justification, no more then God doth daily create the world. But if we take Justification for the <hi>particular acts</hi> of it, <hi>remitting of sin,</hi> and <hi>imputing of Christs righteousnesse,</hi> then these are daily and continually performed: Even as in our natural life, though we be not daily created, yet we need a constant preservation in that life we were created in. Thus it is here, God out of his meer grace did upon our believing put us into a state of Justification, from which favour we should fall every moment, did not God continue us therein. Hence in the Text its <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> God that is continually justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us; if we speak of Sanctification as a <hi>state,</hi> we cannot say that is reiterated, that the godly are frequently sanctified in that sense; but if Sanctification be taken for the <hi>particular acts</hi> of Gods grace, exciting, corroborating, quickning, and the like; these are as daily necessary as our daily bread; thus it is in our Justification, we need a <hi>constant remission,</hi> we want a <hi>perpetual imputation,</hi> because our sins and imperfections are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed daily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> Fourthly, <hi>Our Justification is full and adequate to every purpose in this life.</hi> The Scripture speaks of it as a priviledge, that we are now made partakers thereof; for while we consider how great and glorious an honour and happinesse it is, we may think this is too great to be had in this life, Angels and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saints can have no more: but be not discouraged, God even in this life, though full of rags and ulcers, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce us just through Christ, and deal with us as just, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Being justified freely by his grace;</hi> we have it already, we may for the present make a comfortable improvement of it, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Being now justified by his bloud;</hi> Now its already done for us, and so 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Ye are justified, ye are sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> the one was then done for them as well as the other. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Its God that justifieth the ungodly</hi> in the present tense. If therefore we walk not as justified persons, its our ignorance and unskilfulnesse in these great things. Its true at the day of judgement there will be a solemn and more compleat justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us, as I have elswhere shewed, yet that Justification
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:118921:81"/> spoken of so much by <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistles, doth belong to this life; and indeed we cannot then be said to be justified by faith, for justifying faith in that act, as well as repentance will then cease, every thing that implieth an imperfection in the subject being then abolished; or if we be then justified, <hi>i. e.</hi> declare justified in an Evangelical sense, it will be, because we did in this life believe in Christ, because we once had justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith. Hence this kinde of Justification will cease in heaven, though the praise and glory for it will ever redound to Christ. It is thought that the Union between Christ and his Church shall never cease, but the manner of application of it on our part, and communication of it on Gods part by Ordinances shall not then continue. Though therefore at the day of judgement, we shall have a more publick and solemn Justification before God, Angels and men, in which sense it may be said, We are not compleatly and perfectly justified till then; yet that relateth most to what was in our lives past, not to what we shall be then, seeing at that time the spirits of just men are made perfect, and their bodies crowned with immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propos.</hi> 5. <hi>In a well explained sense, that Proposition is true of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> our Divines, that all believers are justified alike,</hi> The meanest woman believing, though the greatest sinner, a <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi> as much as the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> This indeed is thought blasphemous Doctrine in <hi>Popery,</hi> because they confound Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification and Sanctification, and therefore are necessitated to admit of Degrees, one being more holy then another: but with the Orthodox, Justification is without us, and consists in the favour of God, who looking upon us through Christ, doth justifie from great sins as well as little sins, one sinner is as easily justified as another, and alike justified: yet understand this in a sound sense; for though there be no difficulty with God in pardoning great sins as well as little, and Justification like the sea can drown the tallest <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> as well as a little childe; yet more is required of a greater sinner then of a lesse in the way to Justification. Crimson sins must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> greater sorrow; sins of daily incursion require not such a solemn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as those that waste the conscience; though when
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:118921:82"/> sincerely repenting, the believer is not to doubt of the pardon of great sins, because great. Though to God Justification from all sins be as easie as from one, and from great sins as well as lesse, yet our repentance is to be drawn out according to the nature of our sins, although it must be acknowledged, that the least sinne being against such an infinite Majesty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth our most intensive sorrow, and could we be melted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rivers of tears, yet they could not wash away the least spot of sinne. Again, Though all are equally justified, that is to be understood <hi>intensivè,</hi> as they say, not <hi>extensivè,</hi> that is, though all justified persons have those priviledges which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Justification, they have peace with God, they have a right to heaven and happinesse; yet he that hath more sins pardoned then another, and so hath Christs righteousnesse to cover more imperfections then another, he may be said exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively to be justified more then another is, though he hath not the full and compleat mercy of Justification, more then he that hath sinned lesse. As a Gyant that hath six fingers and six toes, and is vaster in body, hath not a bigger soul (for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to some Philosophers, All souls are essentially equal) then a lesse man, only the operation and virtue of it may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it self more extensively.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> Lastly, <hi>This is not to be understood so, as if faith, which is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying means of our Justification, may not be firmer in some then in others.</hi> For no doubt some have a strong faith, some have a weak faith, and so some apprehend their Justification more stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then others, yet because the worth and merit of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not in the degree of our faith, but in Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse apprehended by it; therefore the weak Christian is as compleatly and perfectly justified as the stronger. This, if duly considered, may establish and revive the drooping Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, who because he hath lesse grace, therefore thinketh he hath lesse Justification: No, this is to say, thou hast a lesse Christ then <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>David</hi> had. Though there be difference in your Sanctification, yet not in your Justification.</p>

                  <p>THere remain two Propositions more that will clear this fundamental Doctrine of Justification.</p>
                  <p>The first is, <hi>That there is no absurdity or inconveniency in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> granting that the form or nature of our Justification is two-fold,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">No inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency in granting the form of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification to be two-fold.</note>
                     <hi>or consists in two things. Bellarmine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Iustific.</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to fasten it upon the Protestants, that they make Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to have a <hi>two-fold form, viz.</hi> Remission of sinne and imputation of righteousnesse, although at the same time he reckons up four different opinions (as he cals them) amongst the Protestants. Our Divines generally in their answer strive to make Justification to consist in one simple form, and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour a reconciliation between those four opinions, making them to be only different expressions, especially <hi>Paraeus, Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat. Bellar.</hi> and <hi>Vorstius Antibellar. de Justif.</hi> with others, make <hi>remission of sinne</hi> and <hi>imputation of righteousnesse</hi> to be the same thing, expressed onely from different terms or extreams: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the expulsion of darknesse, and introduction of light, are the same motion. I shall not here consider the truth of this Assertion, only I may affirm, That there is no errour or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:118921:83"/> inconvenience, to make Justification to consist in two distinct benefits, which may be called a <hi>double form,</hi> for pardon of sinne, and imputation of Christs righteousnesse, are (as is to be shewed) two real distinct mercies, both compleating our Justification. Indeed to assert a two-fold form of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that is <hi>heretogenean</hi> and opposite to one another, as our learned Writers charge the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> with, though that speaks ambiguously and subtilly, <hi>viz.</hi> in remission of sin and infusion of righteousnesse; this we say is very absurd and erroneous; for how can the righteousnesse inherent in us, be a form of Justification, which is an action of God? Its irrational to affirm any such thing; but if the two-fold form be <hi>homogeneous,</hi> of the same kinde, both actions of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, then I see no cause so much to strive against such a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth plainly speak of both these parts, <hi>remission of sinne,</hi> and <hi>imputation of righteousnesse,</hi> and that not as the same thing, but of one as the ground of the other: sinne is pardoned, because righteousnesse is imputed, and certainly imputation of righteousnesse is the more noble part of Justification, and that which is more immediately constitutive of it: Insomuch that some learned Divines make remission of sinne not of the formal nature of Justification, but an effect or consequent of it: but that seemeth not so consonant to Scripture. Now the ground why its no absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to make Justification to consist in two distinct mercies, is <hi>Because this is wholly a gracious favour of God,</hi> and therefore takes in as many ingredients as he pleaseth to appoint: So that the form of Justification, is not like the forms of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, that consist <hi>in indivisibili,</hi> but like any moral or civil forms, which by Law many times require several acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the constitution of them: So that if we would judge of the nature of Justification, we must not examine it by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural motions, such as the expulsion of darknesse or coldness, and the introduction of light or heat, but rather compare it with civil grants of liberty and favour, that the supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate sometimes bestoweth, which may consist of several branches, and many particular priviledges, whereof one is really distinct from the other.</p>

                     <hi>Propos.</hi> 2. <hi>This priviledge of Justification is a real, efficacious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> priviledge in all those effects it is appointed for.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The reality of justification by imputation.</note> Let the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary calumniate never so boldly, yet in this truth <hi>nihil haerebit.</hi> This viper cannot fasten on this Doctrine, <hi>That Iustification is nothing according to the Protestants Doctrine, but a meer puta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive figment, that it is a meer Chimaera.</hi> For first, <hi>Its remission of sinne,</hi> which they themselves acknowledge to be by the Satisfaction of Christ, Is that a meer figment? Is it such a meer fancy and notion to say, Christs death and his sufferings are imputed to us, so that Gods justice is satisfied more then if we had suffered in our own persons? If then this be no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or putative fancy, Why is the righteousnesse of Christ imputed to us? Besides, to call this a meer figment, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to destroy many civil Covenants and acceptilations in Law; Do not the civil Laws of a Magistrate give a real being for many actions which are meerly by imputation? As when a Surety bound for a debtor dischargeth the debt, Is not the debtor by Law acquitted, as if he had done it in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? Yea private men may by their imputation give a reality to some actions: When <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to <hi>Philemon,</hi> that he should charge <hi>Onesimus</hi> his wrongs and debts upon him, if <hi>Philemon</hi> voluntarily did this, and for <hi>Pauls</hi> sake accounted all as discharged, had not here been a real discharge of <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus?</hi> How much more then must this hold between God and us, through <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Surety</hi> and <hi>Mediator.</hi> For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here is a real giving of Christ with all his benefits to us: As <hi>Christ really</hi> died, <hi>really</hi> fulfilled the Law, and suffered the punishment of sin due to us, so this as <hi>really</hi> given to us and made ours, unlesse we will say, that <hi>justifying faith</hi> is but a meer <hi>fancy,</hi> or a <hi>non-entity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There is Gods judging and accounting this Obedience and Satisfaction for us as ours.</hi> Now Gods judgement is alwayes according to truth, what he accounts to another must needs be so. Hence is the phrase <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. of imputing righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; Gods judgement, and imputing of this as ours, makes it a real thing. Hence by this God is said to be <hi>reconciled,</hi> to <hi>forgive,</hi> to be <hi>well-pleased,</hi> all which argue reality.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There is a real grace on our part, which doth receive this
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:118921:84"/> righteousnesse offered,</hi> and that is often said to be <hi>by faith in his bloud;</hi> Now this faith is a most real thing, for <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. its called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Lastly, <hi>The effects of this Iustification are real, and they are the choisest food or refreshment of a Christian,</hi> for hereby <hi>we have peace with God,</hi> we are made <hi>blessed,</hi> we have <hi>boldnesse at the throne of grace,</hi> we can <hi>glory in all tribulations.</hi> Although therefore <hi>Logicians</hi> say, That relation is the least degree of <hi>entity,</hi> yet this <hi>relative change</hi> by our <hi>Iustification</hi> is of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>efficacy,</hi> yea we are to rejoyce in it, as if it were the most <hi>physical</hi> or <hi>natural transmutation</hi> that can be imagined; It is a <hi>relative change,</hi> which hath a real <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and a real <hi>terminus,</hi> as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> well sheweth, though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> very superciliously derideth it, as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Logick.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of learned men about ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</note>Having thus laid down the most material things that clear this truth, let us consider what <hi>Distinctions</hi> sound or unsound that are given by learned men in this point, that so we may receive the gold, and reject the drosse, separating the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous from the vile.</p>
                  <p>And first, <hi>Some speak of a Iustification active, and a Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation passive,</hi> not that they are two <hi>species</hi> or kindes of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but onely the same the same thing considered as coming from <hi>God,</hi> is called <hi>active Iustification;</hi> and the same as received or applied by the believer, is <hi>passive Iustification.</hi> As the Schoolmen distinguish of a <hi>Creatio activa</hi> and <hi>passiva,</hi> making <hi>Creatio passiva</hi> to be the creature it self: now this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction hath its use, for when we say, Faith is an instrument of our Justification, it is not as Justification is <hi>actively consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi> or as it is an action of God, How can any <hi>action</hi> of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:118921:84"/> man be an instrument to Gods action? but as we are passive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>justified,</hi> we are <hi>justified by believing;</hi> its not our faith that doth produce our Justification properly: Therefore, though in Divinity its often said, <hi>Sola fides justificat,</hi> Only faith ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth, yet that is to be resolved passively in this sense, By faith onely we are justified. Thus all those Arguments, If we are justified by faith, then by our own work, and that this is to give too much to faith, yea more then some say they do to works, which they hold a condition of our Justification. All these and the like Objections vanish, because we are not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by faith, as Justification is considered actively, but passively. Its true, God doth never justifie any actively, but the same person is passively justified: Therefore though God did will from eternity to justifie, yet he did not actually justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie till in time. Neither may this make it any difficulty how to affirm Justification a <hi>transient action,</hi> when the knowledge or will of God accepting are <hi>immanent;</hi> for in all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>transient actions</hi> which are, as <hi>Sanctification, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,</hi> Gods will and knowledge about these are <hi>imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> only; the willing of the <hi>existence</hi> or <hi>being</hi> of such a thing in such a <hi>time,</hi> is that which makes it <hi>transient;</hi> I do not here dispute, Whether we are to conceive in God, besides his knowledge and will, an executive power: that would be too tedious, and not very pertinent in this place.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Scripture speaks of a lawful and good Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as also of an unlawfull and sinnefull one, which men are many times guilty of, for Justification is attributed to man as well as God.</hi> Thus <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. <hi>He that justifieth the wicked is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> This is very frequent amongst men, those that will accuse and condemn the generation of the just, as hypocrites and false, yet will justifie and applaud the wicked, as the best men on earth. Its a very sinfull thing to justifie any wicked cause or action, and to this may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all those that a bet or maintain false doctrines and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Its an abomination to the Lord to call evil, good, and falshood, truth; there is also a sinfull justification, when men approve themselves and acquit themselves from sinne, as if they had good hearts, and a good life, though at the same
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:118921:85"/> time, not only the Law accuseth them, but they are abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to God: Oh this false justification is the grand enemy to this Evangelical Justification! Why is it that most who hear this Doctrin are no more affected with it? are not ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it? It is because they have a false righteousnesse; they look upon a justification of their own by the works they have done, and therefore they never desire or pant after this. This is the desperate disease of those who are formal, civil persons, preserved from grosse notorious sins, commonly none are more stupid under this precious Doctrine then they. The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees they were plunged all over in this self-justification, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. This is the sinne our Saviour chargeth upon them, <hi>Ye are they which justifie your selves;</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 18.14. by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a Pharisee and a Publican, is excellently represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that many times they are justified before God, who have no such thoughts of themselves, thinking the clean contrary, at least knowing they have deserved it; and again, there are others who are very confident, and presuming in their own goodnesse, and yet are wholly abhorred by God: Oh that this mother-sinne, this root of all evil were expelled your hearts! Oh that every one were brought to see this, and to cry out, I have no righteousnesse of my own, I look upon my self and tremble, How shall I come into Gods presence? Oh that upon the discovery of the losse of Gods Image, thou couldst go out with defloured <hi>Tamar,</hi> thinking thy self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, saying, And I, poor, sinfull, wretched I, whither shall I go? Prophanenesse is not so great an enemy to Evangelical Justification, as pharisaical righteousnesse. The Jews, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they endeavoured to establish their own righteousness, were wholly ignorant of the true righteousnesse. <hi>Paul</hi> would have thought it blasphemy to speak of all his religious duties while a Pharisee, which he doth afterwards, when a beleever, that they were a losse to him, that they were as dung and drosse, such a thought would have been rejected with great disdain: Oh this is it that undoeth most! You cannot, you dare not begin to think, I am in a condemned estate, all my righteousnesse I presume in, is nothing worth: Oh miserable and wretched man that I am, What shall I do?
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:118921:85"/> The heart of man is so full of it self, that it dareth not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such thoughts. But there is a good Justification, and that is when God justifieth the sinner beleeving in and through Christ. God doth not here pronounce a man righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous without a righteousnesse, or that hath no righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but because cloathed with the righteousnesse of Christ, therefore is the believers nakednesse covered from the eyes of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is an absolute Justification</hi> (if we speak in the general nature of it) <hi>and a comparative Justification.</hi> An <hi>absolute</hi> Justification is, when a crime charged upon such a man, is proved to be false, and the party accused prevaileth over his adversary, so that his innocency may be more cleared. This is ordinary amongst men. There is also a <hi>comparative</hi> Justification, when men, though guilty of sinnes, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with others more hainous, seem to have a kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, <hi>Minora vitia virtutes vocamus,</hi> Ezek. 16.51. Thus <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is said to justifie <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> though places full of great pollution, because they had not committed half of the abominations of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And this compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Justification is very frequent in the world; How many are there, who therefore justifie themselves, because they are not so bad as others, they runne not into the same excess of riot, neither are they so prophane and opposite to what is holy, as many in the world are? Thus they think God will justifie them, because lesse wicked then others, seeing they do justifie themselves: Oh but how little is their ground of comfort in this respect! for thou art to live answerably to Gods Word, thou art to make that the rule to walk by. Though others are worse then thee, yet the Scripture makes thy life and conversation a state of gall and wormwood, and though to greater sinners there be greater torments provided, yet even to lesse sinnes no lesse then everlasting flames are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. A <hi>comparative</hi> Justification is not available without a <hi>positive</hi> and absolute one from God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>There is a Justification</hi> in foro Dei, <hi>in Gods Court, and there is a Justification</hi> in foro Conscientiae, <hi>in the Court of Conscience.</hi> Then are we justified before God, when he no longer charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:118921:86"/> our sins upon us, when he removeth the guilt we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto; Some have thought it hard to conceive of a tribunal God hath in heaven, where before himself and the holy Angels he doth arraign us. And certainly we are not to limit this barre of God to heaven, but so farre, and where God doth demonstrate his anger against sinne so farre, and there may we say God doth erect his tribunal; when God afflicts a man for his sins, either with inward troubles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or outward calamities; this may be called a summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the sinner before his tribunal, then is the offender to apply himself to God for reconciliation, so that this <hi>forum Coeli</hi> is not so to be understood, as if Gods anger were inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there, but as manifesting it self either to the conscience, or otherwise. Therefore this second kinde of Justification in the Court of Conscience is opposed only to the Court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this respect, because many times those whom God ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth in heaven, feel not, or are not perswaded of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification in their hearts: Therefore it is that though parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of unspeakable priviledges, yet they walk in darknesse, as having no comfort at all belonging to them. Although (as was declared formerly) this is not Justification, but the sense of it. <hi>Luther</hi> represented this two-fold Justification by those two passages of <hi>Christ</hi> concerning <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> for Christ spake concerning her, first, when she did not hear him, <hi>That her sins were forgiven her,</hi> and afterwards he spake particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to her, <hi>Be of good comfort, thy sins are forgiven thee;</hi> God then may justifie in heaven, and this by a direct act of faith be applied, but the reflex act or certain knowledge of thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification be separated from it: God hath his wise ends, why he sometimes bestoweth this priviledge, and doth not give the sense of it, sometimes it is his action alone to separate these two; but at other times, and that fals out too often, the people of God through their carelesse, unfruitfull and unprofitable walking raise up a great gulf between the light of Gods favour, and their own souls; so that though he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed blessed that hath his sins pardoned, that hath a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse imputed to him, the Scripture cals this man a blessed man, and no other, yet this blessed man may be in his own
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:118921:86"/> sense miserable and wretched, yea a man appointed for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; therefore be earnest in prayer to God, not onely to justifie thee in heaven, but in thy own heart and spirit: this will make thee walk thankfully, chearfully and fruitfully. This will be like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> spirit in the wheels. This will be oil to thy bones, and wine to thy heart. It was the sense of this made <hi>Paul</hi> in this Chapter thus victoriously triumph over all opposition: especially take heed of such a life, which though it doth not make a total intercision of, yet it makes a sad interruption in our Justification; when the intercourse of this is stopped, it is like a besieged City that hath all the pipes of water cut off, that have no way of refreshment to come to them, then they would like <hi>Dives</hi> be glad of a drop of water.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Some learned men speak of an universal Justification, and of a particular one.</hi> An <hi>universal Justification</hi> they call that, when a man at his first beleeving, is received into Gods favour, then there is an universal pardon of all his sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, God leaveth not out the least farthing, but it is all discharged: And then a <hi>particular Justification</hi> they call that, which is daily iterated in our lives; for as we daily renew particular sins, so we need daily remission of them: Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, as I have shewed, Justification denoteth a state of man, and so is universal and unutterable; yet being they call it a particular Justification, and mean thereby onely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed pardon of particular sins daily committed, I would not much contend in the matter; we cannot call remission of sinne a state, as we call Justification; for although when a sinne is remitted, we have Gods favour as to that particular, yet we commit more sinnes daily, which would indanger us, were we not in a state of Justification, whereby Gods grace will so watch over us, that no sins shall drive us out of this heavenly Paradise.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>There is a Justification of the cause, and a Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the person,</hi> and these are alwayes to be distinguished. <hi>Job</hi> did justifie himself against his friends, and would not let go his <hi>integrity;</hi> this was a Justification of the cause, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact. And thus <hi>David</hi> oftentimes in his particular
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:118921:87"/> quarrel between his adversaries and him, doth often appeal to God, and plead his innocency, and prayes to God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his righteousnesse, but this was not in the <hi>Justification of his person;</hi> then he renounceth his own righteousnesse, and intreats <hi>God would not enter into judgement with him.</hi> To this may be reduced that act of <hi>Phineas,</hi> Psal. 106.31. executing Justice, <hi>and it was imputed to him for righteousnesse,</hi> not for the righteousnesse of his person, but of that act or cause. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a vast difference between this phrase, and that <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. quoted out of <hi>Genesis, Abraham believed, and it was imputed to him for righteousnesse,</hi> as is to be shewed.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>There is a Justification before God and before men.</hi> A Justification before God is, when God himself doth acquit us from our iniquities, and against this no men or devils can put a barre. A Justification before men, is when we walk so holily and exactly according to the principles of faith, that thereby we declare our selves to be true beleevers, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God. This Justification is necessary against all those that glory in the title and name of Christianity, as if a bare faith separated from holinesse was enough. It was one of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his <hi>blasphemies,</hi> as History reports, affirming, that faith did make a man free to do what we would, and that it is a slavery to be obliged by Gods command to any holy duties. The <hi>Gnostiques</hi> also tumbled in this mire; and the <hi>Eunomians,</hi> who delivered, That if a man did hold that faith they taught, the committing of no grosse vices would hinder their salvation. This Justification before men by holy works, is that which <hi>James</hi> pleads for in his Epistle, as some Divines conclude; and certainly it is part of the meaning, as in time is to be shewed. Therefore that men may not deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, through their self-love, saying, They are justified, when God condemneth, the Scripture speaks of a Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by holy works before men, that so the hypocrite may be excluded, and the good tree known by its good fruit.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Shall now conclude this Text, from which we have been informed about the Nature of Justification.</p>
                  <p>There remain two or three distinctions that are controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by several Authours, and these are at present to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Some distinguish of a baptismal Justification, and a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Justification of persons grown up.</hi> This of late hath been agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, especially Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> for the affirmative, maintaining a Baptismal Justification of all children baptized, <hi>De Baptis. Infant. disceptat.</hi> And the learned Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> who is for the negative; and indeed it would be a very hard task to prove the Justification of all Infants baptized out of Scripture. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hereby must necessarily be established <hi>a two-fold Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and that of a different nature,</hi> one of Infants in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, from which there will be often a total and final Apostasie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Of grown persons,</hi> which (according to the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:118921:88"/> Authours opinion, (for I speak not of <hi>Thompson, Bertius,</hi> or others of that metall) is perpetual, and from it can be no falling away. Those learned men therefore <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> and <hi>Ward,</hi> who introduce a <hi>Baptismal Justification,</hi> are forced to make this different <hi>toto genere,</hi> from that of <hi>grown persons;</hi> the one (they say) is amissable, the other can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be lost. But by Scripture direction we cannot walk bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in these paths. Though indeed the Scripture speaks not directly of Infants Justification, yet by consequence it doth plainly and fully demonstrate it. Not that they are justified by actual faith, as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> contend, but this gracious priviledge is applied to them, surely, though not expressibly by us; some difference then must be granted between an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Justification, and a person grown up, but not specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, or in the nature of it, as if the Justification of the one might be totally intercided, and not the other, for <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. the Apostle chaineth them inseparably together, <hi>Whom he hath predestinated he hath justified, and whom he hath justified he hath glorified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This opinion is not so wary as that of others;</hi> for some limit this baptismal Justification only to <hi>elect Infants,</hi> but these extend it to all baptized Infants, because they hold the Sacrament of Baptism <hi>exhibitive of grace,</hi> which is alwayes effectual in the subject receiving, unlesse there be some <hi>obex</hi> or impediment put by the <hi>Suscipient,</hi> which (say they) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in Infants: But to make such an universal Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of all visible members of a Church, is a great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, If it be granted, that the Sacrament of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism is not onely obsignative, but exhibitive of grace, yet that doth not follow, that it must be in all, and at that time of Baptism, but it may be exhibitive of grace in its due time, when it shall please God by the word preached to work it, and the original corruption every one is born in, is <hi>obex</hi> enough, seeing by that every Infant is a childe of wrath. This doctrinal assertion hath too much influence in the hearts of all, for do not most rest on their Baptism as the ground of their Justification and Salvation, never attending <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>to those
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:118921:88"/> qualifications of an holy life, and renouncing the wayes of sinne and Satan to which our Baptism doth ingage us. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Sacraments are usually called the <hi>organical</hi> means of our Justification on Gods part; but this is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, as if they had some <hi>inward, latent, physical virtue</hi> in them, as <hi>natural causes</hi> or medicinal pils have, to produce real effects: No they are moral causes only instituted by God; and although he hath promised to go along with his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, yet they do not <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> meerly by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them convey grace, unlesse faith in the receiver make them effectual, as digestion in the stomack makes meat to nourish; therefore to a dead man food would do no good, neither do the Sacraments, where spiritual life is not laid as a foundation. In Popery this Justification by the <hi>opus operatum</hi> of Sacraments is much advanced. The Church (saith <hi>Beca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>) hath two Baths to wash away its filth, the one of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism for original sinne, the other of Penance for actual; and for the former he alledgeth a place out of <hi>Gregory, He that doth not beleeve all his sins are washed away in Baptism, doth beleeve not Pharaoh and the Aegyptian host were drowned in the red Sea.</hi> But although the Sacraments God hath appointed be not empty mockeries, yet they are effectual onely, where there is due preparation. As the Jews did generally rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Circumcision for Justification; and we may perceive by <hi>Pauls</hi> zealous disputes in his Epistles to the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> that works of the Ceremonial Law, as well as of the Moral, were pleaded for by false teachers, as the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Justification; so still the same corrupt opinion, as so much sweet poison is received by most men, that they were justified in their Baptism, and therefore they need not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselves with any more fears in this point. But if thou wert justified then, thou wast also sanctified then, for these alwayes go together as light and heat in the fire, and if san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, then surely it would have been demonstrated in an holy and heavenly life. Are they not the manifest signes of the contrary? Do not therefore delude thy self, and think to mock God: if there were baptismal Justification, there was also baptismal Regeneration, <hi>and he that is born of God
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:118921:89"/> sinneth not, neither can he (viz.</hi> so as wholly to give himself up to the service of it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.) <hi>because he is born of God, and his seed abideth in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>Another controverted Distinction is; of an actuall Justification from all eternity, and a declarative Justification in time.</hi> This is the great <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> which hath been at large confuted in my former Treatise. Indeed such a distinction hath unhappily fallen from the pen of some eminent and orthodox Writers, though not improved to such foolish and absurd consequences as the <hi>Antinomists</hi> do. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever such a distinction hath no foundation in the Scripture which restraineth Justification to the beleever, and describes the godly man to be for the present justified, so that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was under the wrath of God, <hi>Gods purpose to justifie is not Justification, no more then his purpose to glorifie is glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Neither doth this argue any change in God, but in the creature, for he did immutably from all Eternity will such a change upon the sinner beleeving; God therefore is not properly said to be altered, but man is. Besides its whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irrational to make our Justification in this life, to be only declarative, as if God did not indeed pardon sinne, but did only manifest that he had done it already from all Eternity; How then can <hi>promises</hi> of pardon be made good, or well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, which are upon the supposition of our believing and turning to God, that then he will turn away his anger, which by the fore-said position was never upon any elect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, all the while he was in an unregenerate estate, and in the height of his impiety? But enough hath been said to this already.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, The <hi>Arminians,</hi> and all those who hold a total Apostasie from Justification once received, <hi>must distinguish of Justification as they do of Election, an absolute Justification, and a conditionate.</hi> An <hi>absolute</hi> is, when God foreseeth that a man will persevere and continue to the last in his faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, upon which provision God doth then absolutely justifie him. A <hi>conditionate</hi> is, of every man believing and repenting, provided, that he persevere in the same: So that as by their Doctrine no man can be absolutely elected till he die, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:118921:89"/> absolutely justified, for he may fall into such sinnes, as that though formerly justified, yet now condemned, yea to day he may be justified, and to morrow thrown out of that estate. This false and uncomfortable position is maintained by <hi>Thompson</hi> in his <hi>Diatribe,</hi> against whom Bishop <hi>Abbot</hi> hath solidly written, Those that are once justified are never again cast out of his favour, they may want the sense of it; The Sunne may be in an eclipse, but not removed out of its orb; and as <hi>Hooker</hi> observeth well in his Discourse of Justification, added to his <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy;</hi> As Christ once died, but rose again never to die more, death hath no more power over him; so a justified man once allied to God through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, doth from that time forward as necessarily live, as Christ himself by whom it is that he doth live. In his judgement therefore, which is also consonant to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, a justified man can no more cease to live in this state of Justification, then Christ can cease to live in heaven; and the reason is, because of that immortal and indissoluble <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which is between <hi>Christ the Head,</hi> and <hi>every believer a member</hi> unto him. Thy Justification therefore doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend in the continuance of it upon thy strength and thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: woe be to us, if we had no other support; but it is built on Christ himself, <hi>who is the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever:</hi> So thy Justification also will alwayes be the same, though thou art many times changed with uncertain fears and doubts.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The great and famous distinction which hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> made so much noise in the books of late Writers; is that <hi>fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and new invention of the Papists, of a <hi>first and second Justification.</hi> The first Justification they call that, when a wicked man is at first made holy and righteous, having a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural principle of grace infused in him, which doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently justifie him. A second Justification they call that, whereby a man being already just, doth increase and grow in his righteousnesse, and so is more justified. For the first Justification, they would perswade us, that they hold it to be onely of grace, when yet they hold such <hi>preparatory di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spositions</hi> that are <hi>merits of congruity</hi> to obtain it. For the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:118921:90"/> Justification, they plainly acknowledge, that is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our <hi>merits,</hi> and the good use of grace already received. By this distinction they think <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> may be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. A great difficulty they grant it to be, how to accord both those Apostle, but they think this distinction reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all; <hi>Paul</hi> (say they) speaks of the first Justification, for that is of an ungodly man, and it is by grace freely. But <hi>James</hi> speaks of a second Justification, and that is by the works we do. Indeed <hi>Becanus Tom.</hi> 1. and <hi>Tapper Art.</hi> 8. speak of a two-fold first Justification; the first <hi>Tapper</hi> cals, <hi>per modum simplicis generationis,</hi> or as <hi>Becanus,</hi> when one is made first that was neither first, or unjust before. Thus, they say, <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> were justified, there Justification was not of a person ungodly before, but were created in this purity. The second kinde of first Justification, they make to be by way of a qualitative alteration, as when that is made hot which was formerly cold; so a wicked and ungodly man, he by the grace of God is made just and holy. This, they call, the first Justification. But this distinction, as they explain it, is full of falshood and reproach to the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ; for both these Justifications are built upon a false foundation, <hi>viz. That our inherent righteousnesse ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual or actual, is that which doth justifie us in Gods sight.</hi> This (as is to be shewed) is against all those places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which proclaim imperfection and defilements adhering to the best works we do. Its contrary to the frame of all the godly mens hearts that ever lived, who prayed against Gods severe entring into judgement with them, knowing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification in the sight of God, by any thing they can do, is wholly impossible.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This distinction of first and second cannot hold, <hi>Because a man is justified in the same manner and way in the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse of his life, as at first.</hi> Hence <hi>Abraham</hi> Rom. 4. when yet he did abound with many fruitful works of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, was said to be <hi>justified by faith.</hi> The Adversaries do acknowledge <hi>Paul</hi> speaks there of the first Justification, and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> in whom the Apostle instanceth, was not then made righteous of wicked, for a long while before he had served God in all holinesse.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:118921:90"/>3. There cannot be a first and second Justification in the Popish sense, because <hi>the first is said to live by faith,</hi> Hab. 2. which is three times alledged in the New Testament, and is applied to our Justification, as well as to dependance upon God in outward calamities; yea living by faith in respect of Justification, is the foundation of the other life by faith. Till by faith we live, receiving the favour of God through Christ, we are not able in other conditions to exercise the believing acts of dependance; seeing therefore that the first mans life (his life, not only his first conversion) is by faith, and that in respect of Justification, therefore in the whole progresse of his life, he is justified but one way. After thou hast been many years a proficient in the way of godlinesse, thou art to put forth acts of faith for Justification, as humbly and as feelingly of thy own unworthinesse, as at thy very entrance into godlinesse. Did not <hi>Paul</hi> when he had ranne very farre in the race of Christianity, yet <hi>forget all that was behinde, and desire to be found only in the righteousnesse which is by faith.</hi> So that whereas the Doctrine of Justification is reproached for a Doctrine that breedeth security, pride and negligence in holy duties, There is no Doctrine like that so naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to encrease humility, an holy fear and self-emptinesse, for by this we are taught even in the highest degree of our Sanctification, to look out of our selves for a better righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse; we look upon our selves in the best of our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual glory, as so many <hi>Jobs</hi> on the dunghill, or <hi>Lazarusses</hi> begging at the rich mans gate; for how can the soul but be filled with great shame and confusion, that seeth nothing but deformity in it self, that dares not by any works he hath done, approach into Gods presence? By <hi>Sanctification</hi> he hath righteousnesse indeed inherent, but not perfect: by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi> he hath righteousnesse perfect, but not inherent. Let this then be setled upon thee, as at first thou wast justified freely by the grace of God: Thou sawest thy by-past sinnes compassing thee about, and therefore didst look out of thy self to Christ. Thus it is to be alwayes, though thou hast not the same sins, yea though now thou aboundest with many graces, and hast a large increase in holiness, yet such are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:118921:91"/> and failings accompanying thee in all thou doest, that thou canst not but cry out; Oh let me be covered with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter righteousnesse then that of mine own!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There cannot be a first and second Justification in the mentioned sense, <hi>Because even those who are already reconciled to God, are yet daily to endeavour reconciliation with him.</hi> All new sinnes are apt to make new breaches, and these make, though not new total, yet partial reconciliations. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19, 20. when he said, <hi>God was in Christ reconciling of men to himself,</hi> he addresseth his speech even to those that were reconciled, that they would be reconciled to God, that is, they would not onely abide, and continue in that state, but as often as any failings and imperfections did break forth, they would by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance turn to God, and entreat his favour toward them; an after-reconciliation then is not by any merits or good works of ours, but by the same gracious foundation it was at first wrought. Hence <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 32. pronounceth it as an universal Proposition, of every man at every time, whether at the first or at the last, <hi>Blessed is he, whose iniquities are covered, and his sinnes not imputed to him.</hi> Know then for thy direction (for its a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be rightly enformed herein) that all the day, all the year, all thy life long, thou art to be by faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a righteousnesse without them, as thou doest every moment take in breath. Some have urged that phrase, <hi>Put on the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> Rom. 12.14. implying, that as every day we are to put on our garments to cover our nakednesse, so we are to put on Christ for the covering of all our imperfections. This is the difference between man and beast, man comes naked into the world, <hi>Pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta de propriis vestiuntur</hi> (saith <hi>Augustine</hi>) and thus it is with man <hi>Theologically</hi> considered, he comes naked and destitute of all righteousnesse, and hath no covering of his own, but must be found in the Lord Christ, whose righteousnesse God judgeth as ours; neither is God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at that time, or judgeth otherwise then according to truth; for Christs righteousnesse is truly ours, though
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:118921:91"/> not inherently, When our Divines delight to expresse this by <hi>Jacobs</hi> getting the blessing in his elder brothers cloathes, Papists reply, That we make God like old <hi>Isaac,</hi> that through blindenesse cannot discern what is truth; but to say, the hands are indeed the hands of Christ, but the voice the voice of a sinner. This is wilfully to mistake our words, for we all say, God judgeth as the truth is, neither doth he justifie us without a righteousnesse, onely this is not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in us.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have discovered the falshood of that distinction of a first and second Justification, which they may multiply to the hundredth and thousandth Justification as well as the second.</p>
                  <p>But there are some learned and <hi>Orthodox Writers, that do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> admit of a first and second Justification, but not in the Popish sense, they utterly abhorre that, yet they affirm a first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Justification. Ludovic. De Dieu in Rom. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>v</hi> 4. a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry learned man, is large in asserting this. The <hi>first Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is that acknowledged by the Orthodox, whereby, though sinners in our selves, yet believing are justified before God. The <hi>second,</hi> whereby thus justified out of our selves, we are justified before God in our selves. The first Justification is the cause of the second, the second is the effect and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the first. The first is by faith, the second by works, and both are necessary; and if it should be objected, That then we are justified by the works of the Law; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, That these works of Sanctification are not the works of the Law <hi>ratione originis,</hi> for the Spirit of God doth work them, but <hi>ratione normae,</hi> in respect of the rule by which they are prescribed: And further then (saith he) are we justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the works of the Law, when they are performed, as the condition of that Covenant: But this opinion looketh not on the Law so, but as its now altered; for the Law is deprived of that dominion it once had, and being subjected to Christ, cannot but praise and approve those works which flow from faith, and are wrought by Gods Spirit, though they be not satisfactorily answerable to the rigorous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of it: So that by this opinion, when we are first justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:118921:92"/> by the imputed righteousnesse of Christ, then afterwards <hi>our works are accounted also unto us for righteousnesse.</hi> God justifieth us, as being free from prophanenesse and hypocrisie, walking sincerely in obedience to his commands; so that though an inherent righteousnesse be made the foundation of this second Justification, yet it is not from any worth or dignity, proportioned to the rule of holinesse, but from the worth of that imputed righteousnesse from which it floweth, and through whose dignity it is accepted of, and of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Justification he makes <hi>James</hi> to speak, and so reconcileth him with <hi>Paul.</hi> Its true, other learned men speak something to this purpose; Not only <hi>Bucer,</hi> who is known to place Justification both in imputed righteousnesse and inherent, thereby endeavouring a reconciliation with the Papists, for for which <hi>Paraeus</hi> blameth him as too facil. But <hi>Calvin, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. <hi>Sec.</hi> 8. It is one thing, saith he, to dispute, what works avail of themselves, another thing What after the righteousnesse of faith is established, premise remission of sinne and Christs perfection, whereby what is imperfect is covered, and then the good works done by beleevers, <hi>Justa censentur, vel (quod idem est) in Justitiam imputantur,</hi> are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unto righteousnesse. To this purpose also <hi>Zanchy, Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>de Justif. Thes.</hi> when a man is first reconciled to God by faith, then a beleever is afterwards accepted of by God, for his good works. Although this be thus asserted, and all the <hi>Orthodox</hi> do readily grant, That our good works are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God through Christ, yet that this should be called a second Justification, and that before God, there seemeth to be no ground from the Scripture; for (as you heard) <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> after their first Justification are still said in the some manner to be <hi>justified,</hi> viz. <hi>by faith, not by works.</hi> Its true, God doth accept of beleevers as sincere, that they are not hypocrites, but they are not justified by this; for <hi>David</hi> crieth out, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. <hi>Who can understand the errours of his heart?</hi> so that there is hypocrisie in the heart of the most upright man for which God might justly condemn him.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving discussed the nature of Justification in the general, I shall proceed further in this manner: First, To handle negatively what is not that Righteousnesse, whereby a man is justified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are many false righteousnesses exalted for Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:118921:93"/> and shall from this Text in the general, inform how prone we are to seek for a righteousnesse to justifie us, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then God hath appointed.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle in the Chapter preceding charged the Jews with heavy and sad things, but that they might not think this spoken from hatred, but love unto them, he doth very passionately insinuate himself into their affections in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Chapter, which is expressed <hi>quoad affectum,</hi> and <hi>quoad effectum:</hi> in respect of his inward affection, he tels them <hi>his hearts desire is toward them,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry emphatical, and as <hi>Hierom</hi> saith, cannot be translated by one word, unlesse a man should say <hi>Placentia.</hi> It was not then every kinde of affection, but the top and highest he had towards them.</p>
                  <p>Again <hi>quoad effectum,</hi> his love is seen in his prayer to God for them <hi>that they might be saved:</hi> Spiritual love is the most active and vigorous. To love a man to his salvation, is more then temporal beneficence whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>In the second verse he giveth a reason of these strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires towards them, he gives them good testimonial Letters, onely he corrects them with a diminution, <hi>I bear them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that they have a zeal, but not according to knowledge.</hi> Zeal though never so fervent in matters of Religion, yet if preposterous, if not regulated by Gods Word, is like the strange fire offered upon Gods Altar. Its better, saith <hi>Augustine, Claudicare in viâ,</hi> then <hi>strenuè currere extra viam.</hi> The Jews did runne, but it was out of the way; They were like a fertile piece of ground, but overgrown with weeds: Had their zeal been right both in respect of its original, and its manner, and its object, and its end; Then <hi>Paul</hi> would have delighted to have sown his spiritual seed in such prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ground.</p>
                  <p>In the third verse, he instanceth, wherein their blinde zeal did hurry them into destruction, and that was in the main point and hinge of their salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> about their Justification, they set up a <hi>righteousnesse</hi> to be justified by, which was directly contrary to the righteousnesse of God; so that their dangerous miscarriage is expressed in the sinne it
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:118921:94"/> self, and in the causes of it, the sinne it self is not to submit or subject themselves to the righteousnesse of God; The righteousnesse by which we are justified, is called <hi>Gods righteousnesse,</hi> both because he causeth and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, as also, because its adequately answerable unto his will, and accepted by him, and because it is a righteousnes not of a man meerly, but of God also, as in time is to be shewed. Now to this righteousnes, which with all their hearts and open souls, they should have received, because nothing else could commend them to God, they did not submit themselves, or they were not submitted, such was the rebellion and self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse within them, that they would not rest wholly upon this righteousnesse. Here not the full stomack, but even the empty loaths the honey-comb, though they had a conceited fulnesse. This righteousnesse as its called twice in the Text <hi>Gods righteousnesse,</hi> so its illustrated by the opposite <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>their own righteousnesse.</hi> Its called their own righteousnesse, both in respect of the principle from which it did flow, they did those works by the strength of nature without the grace of God, and their own righteousnesse in respect of the subject and inherencie; for suppose any of the Jews had been with <hi>Paul</hi> converted, yet they would not with him be found in their own righteousnesse, but in that which is by faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. so that the works of grace may be called our own righteousnesse, when we seek to be justified by them, although in respect of their original they are not ours; as a mans soul is his own soul, though at first infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by God alone. Thus you have their sin.</p>
                  <p>The Causes are, first, their <hi>ignorance,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. There was their <hi>pride</hi> and wilfulnesse in this way; they did <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, from sick and weak persons, who would stand, but through their imbecillity fall down immediately, or as a man that would set up an Image, but for want of life it tumbleth down presently; as he said, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it wants
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:118921:94"/> something within; as the <hi>Israelites</hi> endeavoured to set up their <hi>Dagon</hi> before the <hi>Ark,</hi> though that tumbled down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. Thus these Jews endeavoured to establish their poor, weak and cadaverous righteousnesse in the presence of Gods glorious, just and holy Majesty, which yet was no more able to stand before him, then stubble before the fire.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is their <hi>rebellion</hi> added to their <hi>pride,</hi> they would not <hi>submit themselves;</hi> a man naturally is as disobedient to a promise to receive the righteousnesse offered by faith, as he is to a Command to fulfill the duty thereof. This is good to be observed, thy heart was not once more averse and unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward against the holy commands of God, then now since broken for sinne, it is opposite to Gods promises for a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse; Not onely our Sanctification, but our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication also findes strong rebellion against it in all our hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That every man naturally is very prone to set up a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his own to be justified by it,</hi>

Not onely righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse inherent, but imputed also, is extreamly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to mans corrupt nature; we say, Christ shall not reign over us in respect of his Priestly Office, purchasing a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse for us, as well as in his Kingly power enjoyning holy Laws to walk by.</p>

                     </note> That its imbred in all to seek after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther righteousnesse for Justification, then what is Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, appeareth, <hi>In the corrupt Doctrines and Opinions of all
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:118921:95"/> men almost about it.</hi> As there were but <hi>eight persons preserved in the Ark,</hi> when <hi>the whole world was drowned;</hi> so there are some few preserved in the sound and true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Justification, when almost the whole world <hi>erreth</hi> dangerously, if not damnably about it. As for those that are without the Church, its no wonder, if they, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a Christ, so also the righteousnesse which comes by him. The <hi>Jew,</hi> the <hi>Turk,</hi> the <hi>Pagan,</hi> all of them approach to God as absolutely considered, and so expect acceptance by those works they do. No wonder if the Jews do so now, for they did of old so, when yet they had the Prophets discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gospel-righteousnesse to them, and all their Sacrifices might abundantly convince them, that they had nothing of their own to put any confidence in. Hence God by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isaiah</hi> threatens, <hi>Chap.</hi> 51.12. <hi>I will declare thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and thy works, for they shall not profit thee;</hi> God will make them ashamed of their righteousnesse, as well as their sins; Oh this is excellent, when a man is amazed and in an holy manner confounded even at his holinesse, as well as at his offences! Therefore he addeth <hi>vers.</hi> 13. <hi>He that putteth his trust in me (viz.</hi> renouncing his righteousnesse) <hi>shall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the Land;</hi> and <hi>vers.</hi> 15. <hi>The high and lofty one that dwels in the high and holy place, doth also dwell with the humble and contrite spirit to revive that.</hi> Now, who is this humble and contrite spirit? Even that which goeth out not onely of his sinnes, but of all his duties and graces, and being ashamed and cast down in himself, is revived only by the grace of God without him. Come we to those <hi>within the Church</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse their faith in Christ, and you would think there was an universal consent in this great priviledge of Justification. But nothing is more controverted, How much unjustified is the Scripture-Justification of most? What accusations and condemnations of one another about Justification? Insomuch that <hi>set some few, even a remnant, aside, comparatively, the whole Christian world, both Doctors and people, learned and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fasten on a Justification by works;</hi> and that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth industriously oppose they labour to bring in, but with many subtil distinctions, and fair disguises: the <hi>Papist,</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:118921:95"/> the <hi>Arminian,</hi> the <hi>Socinian,</hi> the <hi>Castellian,</hi> the <hi>Swinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldian,</hi> with divers others, all conspire in this, That our righteousnesse is inherent by which we are justified; most of them make <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>works,</hi> some few <hi>faith only,</hi> as its a <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious act;</hi> so that the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>credere, the very believing is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by God, as a full, compleat, legal righteousnesse.</hi> Now, whence cometh it, that all do so readily joyn in this falshood? but because Justification by something in us is so pleasing and connatural to flesh and bloud: Its a Doctrine that naturally breedeth in our hearts; and therefore as all men grant the fire to burn, and the Sunne to shine, because this is evident to sense; No lesse do all conspire in this, that we must do some thing, work some thing, that by that we may be accepted of by God. So that the universality of such corrupt Doctrines, shew what is the root in our heart. These <hi>Froggs</hi> could not breed but from such noisome spawn.</p>
                  <p>A second Discovery of our pronenesse to a Justification <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that is not Evangelical, is, <hi>From the confidence and cordial trust men put in the religious duties they perform.</hi> So that what ought to be given to Christ and his righteousnesse, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their duties. That look as the <hi>Idolater</hi> gives that worship and honour to wood and stone, which is due to the wise and holy God only: Thus such hope and confidence do men generally put in the good works they do, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only unto Christ. Our Saviour represents this in the Pharisee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. though he <hi>giveth God thanks that he is not thus and thus, that he doth pray and fast,</hi> yet it is by this <hi>working</hi> he looks to be accepted. There is not a word of his sinne, of his millions of imperfections in every duty he did: But as high as he was in his own thoughts, so low and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable he was in the sight of God. That is a remarkable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>We are the Circumcision, who rejoyce in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh,</hi> that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all duties and priviledges, making the glory and joy of our souls to be in Christ onely: Oh take heed then of this deadly poison, to have a secret trust and rest of soul in the good things thou doest! The stone is not more enclining to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:118921:96"/> fall downward, then thou art to take up thy rest here, and though thou art no prophane or ungodly sinner; This heart-confidence in duties performed, is milstone heavy enough to drown thee in the sea. This leprosie did spread it self over the <hi>Jewish Nation;</hi> this made them set up the works of the Law against Christ; and the <hi>generality of Christians are as much formalized, and made Justitiaries as ever they were.</hi> This sinne devoureth secretly without a noise, as the moth doth cloath, it doth not as grosse sinnes consume like a roaring Lion.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Men are averse to Evangelical righteousnesse, in that they are so apt to self-justification, and clearing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, all is clean and good in their eyes.</hi> They have good hearts, good works, God is their good God; there is nothing (as they judge) but good in them, when their hearts, if ransaked into by Gods word, is a noisom dunghill; This was the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical righteousnesse, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>Ye are they which justifie your selves.</hi> And so the Jews of old, though under Gods grievous judgements, yet would plead with God, as if they were not guilty; they thought Gods wayes were hard and inequal: So hard a matter is it to acknowledge sinne, and to be willing to be ashamed because of it, whereas the <hi>Publican that went away justified,</hi> he humbled himself, he bewailed himself a sinner; and certainly then is a man in an hopefull way for Justification, when with <hi>Job he abhorreth himself,</hi> because of the spiritual sores and ulcers that are all over him, then he is nearest to God, when he sets himself afarre off, as not being worthy to come into Gods presence; when, as our Saviour directs, thou setst thy self at the lower end, then will Christ bid thee come up higher: But oh the self-love and self-flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which reigneth in every man: who is willing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced a sinner, to accuse and arraign himself, as a sinner, to judge and abhorre himself, as guilty of all the wrath God threatens in his Word! Oh how hardly is he brought to think himself undone, to see his nakednesse and poverty, to acknowledge he is a beast and a devil! No, this will never be done, till God break and soften the heart, and therefore how many are admiring the vertuous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:118921:96"/> life they have lived, as he did the glorious <hi>Babel</hi> he had built, and even then, when (as he was) they are near ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confusion?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Our pronenesse to a contrary way of Justification <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> then God hath appointed, is seen in that want of an appetite, and heavenly relish, which a gracious heart useth to have in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Justification.</hi> Were people spiritualized, sensible of the burden of sinne, of the infinite imperfections that cleave to them, of their inability to answer God in any particular; There is no truth in the world would be so acceptable to them as this; for this they would say, <hi>The word of God is sweeter then the honey-comb;</hi> Why is the Gospel commended by so many admirable Titles, The <hi>precious</hi> Gospel, the <hi>glorious</hi> Gospel? but because of the admirable excellency an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical spirit findes in these things. At the first Reformation out of <hi>Popery,</hi> when this pearl of Justification lay all over covered with dirt and mire, the superstitious Doctrines of Popery, but by the means of those excellent Worthies God raised up, discovered and purified; How many humble, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and contrite hearts did God also fashion by his grace, that for that truth, above all, in Reformation, did blesse and praise God for? For as <hi>Calvin</hi> well urgeth, What foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation can be laid either for true piety, or solid comfort, if a man in the first place be not satisfied in what relation he stands to God, upon what terms God and he are? Oh but now this manna is loathed! Now many Sermons may be preached, and the auditors very few whose hearts melt, and are ravished within them, while they hear of it, I tell thee, <hi>Thou canst not discover a more carnal, dead heart, destitute of Gods Spirit, then to sit like a stock or a stone under the preaching of this truth.</hi> Thou wouldst (if heavenly) finde all thy bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els move within thee at the approach of this Doctrine unto thee; As they received Christ corporally, crying <hi>Hosanna,</hi> and saying, <hi>Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord;</hi> Thus wouldst thou do concerning this Gospel-truth: But thy heart like <hi>Nabals</hi> is a stone in this case, and thou findest no heavenly excellency in this pearl, because thou art of a swinish nature, and so preferrest thy base lusts before it.</p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:118921:97"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Our aversnesse to a Gospel-Justification is discovered by the want of an hunger and thirst after Christ.</hi> We have not an high and inestimable value that we put on him; <hi>Paul</hi> is sick alwayes while he hath not Christ: The Church in the <hi>Canticles</hi> is not more ravished with her Spouse, then <hi>Paul</hi> with Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>He determineth to know nothing but Christ crucified,</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>He counts all things dung and drosse for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ;</hi> and whence hath <hi>Paul</hi> this high esteem of Christ? Even because of the spiritual hunger and thirst that is in him. Never did hungry man long for a morsel of bread, never did <hi>Samson</hi> long for water through thirst, more then he doth after Christ, because of the spiritual need and want he findes of him. Christ as a Mediatour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the Scripture, is like the brazen Serpent to a sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pained beholder. But the generality of Christians, though they name Christ, and speak of him, yet they do not with the Church runne after him in the sweetnesse of his ointment, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Why it is so. Whence it is that men are so prone to set up a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their own.</note>Thus we have heard this truth discovered by the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>First, <hi>A doctrinal ignorance of some main points in Religion, is that which makes many so mistake in Justification.</hi> This you see is the cause in my Text, named as the first of all. Their ignorance in these ensuing particulars,<note place="margin">I. A doctrinal Ignorance of some points in Religion.</note> makes men not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, or carefull of a Gospel-Justification.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>An ignorance of the pure, holy and just nature of God,</hi> that he is a God of such absolute purity, that nothing but abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> holinesse can consist before him; that those things which may even dazle the eyes of men, are yet but as dung in Gods account, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes then to behold iniquity;</hi> See the glorious purity and Majesty of God expressed nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and mans contemptible vanity respectively, <hi>Job</hi> 25.5, 6. <hi>Job</hi> 4.17, 18, 19. <hi>Job</hi> 15.15, 16. There we see the heavens and Angels themselves <hi>are not clean in his eyes,</hi> how much lesse weak and sinful men? He doth not there speak of Apostate Angels, but those that continue in their purity. Now even the Angels themselves are ashamed, though not having the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:118921:97"/> least blemish, <hi>they cover their faces,</hi> even the noblest part of them, because God is of such infinite Majesty: would not this then debase the most holy man that is, if he did consider what a God he hath to do with? And though men may proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vainly dispute about the <hi>condignity</hi> of their works to Justification, yet when they come to die, and shall think of appearing before so holy a God, they will quickly pull down their <hi>top;</hi> and if it were possible with <hi>Adam</hi> to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the presence of God, when they shall see their nakednesse; certainly if Angels be thus debased, what shall poor, weak, sinfull man do?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Ignorance of the purity of the Law, and the exact, strict <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> obligation thereof.</hi> Did men consider what that holinesse is, which the Law requireth, that it pronounceth a curse to all that fail but in the least particular, that it will admit of no obedience but what is perfect; then every man must cry out, That they are but dead men, and damned men by the Law: This makes the Apostle so vehemently dispute against those presumptuous conceits of righteousnesse by the Law; if it be so, <hi>then Christ died in vain, and if Christ died in vain, then are we yet in our sins;</hi> if therefore men make godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of such a size and measure as they please, thinking that is all God requireth which they do, no wonder if they go boldly and demand a crown of glory as the reward of their labour; no marvel if they say with that wretched Friar, <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de mihi vitam aeternam, quam mihi debes, sive velis, sive nolis,</hi> Give me that eternal life thou owest me, whether thou wilt or no: Oh pestilent mouth to utter such <hi>blasphemy</hi> that infecteth the very air! How contrary is this to the humble spirit of believers, which hath alwayes <hi>in forma pauperis,</hi> begged for the glory of heaven? That say spiritually, what <hi>Job</hi> spake corporally, <hi>Naked</hi> (of all merits, unlesse of hell and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>came I into the world, and naked</hi> (of all merits of glory) <hi>shall I go out of the world.</hi> Its not then every righteousnesse, though applauded and admired by men, that the Law doth approve; Was any righteousnesse more glorious then that of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> yet <hi>Matth</hi> 5. our Saviour pronounceth, <hi>That unlesse ours exceed that, we cannot enter into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:118921:98"/> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Paul</hi> there proclaimeth what high and puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed thoughts he once had, while a Pharisee, he thought to have life by the Law, whereas <hi>Augustine</hi> said, <hi>Da Domine quod jubes, &amp; jube quod vis;</hi> Lord, give me to do what thou commandest, and then command what thou wilt: he can bid the Law command what it will, he is ready to obey: Oh but how ashamed and confounded is this <hi>Paul,</hi> when once he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands what this spiritual and holy Law is, <hi>Then the Law revived, and he died,</hi> then he was undone, he could not hold up his head any more; then he looked on himself as a <hi>Judas,</hi> as a <hi>Cain,</hi> then he seeth every thing prepared to undo him; Then as <hi>Paul</hi> said in the contrary <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The whole Creation groaned for the liberty of the sons of God,</hi> So might he say, All the creatures groaned to bear such a wretched sinner, and longed for his perdition: Go then and look into the pure <hi>Glasse</hi> of the Law, as <hi>James</hi> exhorts, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.25. and there thou wilt see such spots and blemishes, such deformities upon thee, that thou wilt be a monster in thy own eyes, and not able to endure thy self.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>Ignorance of the reliques of corruption abiding in us, and conflicting with us, makes us not esteem this Gospel-Justification:</hi> For a man might think, and thus many write in their Books, Though while a man lived in his sins, he needed a Justification by grace that must deliver him, yet when once he hath a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural principle, and a divine nature within him, then certainly he needs not such a Gospel justification: but all this is, because they know not <hi>the combate of the flesh and the Spirit;</hi> they feel not the struglings of those two twins within them; if they did, they would easily believe there was no appearing but in the <hi>wedding garment of Christs righteousnesse;</hi> Then they would consider how truly the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> said, that not their unrighteousnesse, but their very <hi>righteousnesses were like a menstruous rag,</hi> Isa. 64.6. What are our unrighteousnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and our sins, if our holy things be thus compared to what is most abominable?</p>

                  <p>Therefore in the fourth place, <hi>Ignorance, or a not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to Christ both in his person and office, is that which makes them lay a dead childe in the room of a living one, a dead and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty righteousnesse in stead of that which is efficacious and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> Did we truly consider of this great and unspeakable mystery, That <hi>God</hi> should become <hi>Man,</hi> and be as a Surety for us, suffering and doing what we should, it would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately make us abandon our own works, and flie to him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Scripture speaks of his <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Office:</hi> of his
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:118921:99"/>
                     <hi>Person,</hi> that he is both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> and without either of these he could not have been a Mediator: And for his <hi>Office,</hi> the Scripture is plentifull in informing of us, That he was not made man, or became obedient to the Crosse for his <hi>own self,</hi> but wholly <hi>for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>He was made sinne for us, that we might become the righteousnesse of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>Who of God is made unto us wisdome, and righteousnesse, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and redemption:</hi> So <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. <hi>It pleased the Father that in him all fulnesse should dwell;</hi> where the Apostle sheweth at large, <hi>that he is the Head of the Church,</hi> so that we are <hi>compleat in him,</hi> Chap. 2.10. Why then is it that the Scripture doth represent <hi>Christ</hi> in a far greater glory then ever <hi>Solomon</hi> had? Why doth it make him the Ocean of all our joy and hope, the <hi>fulnesse that filleth all</hi> our emptinesse? but because we should not look for any fulnesse or compleatnesse in our selves, but in Christ alone: So that whatsoever in Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is attributed to thy self, so much is taken from Christ. The Scripture cals Christ often <hi>Our Righteousnesse,</hi> it mentioneth nothing for our righteousnesse but him. All the children of God have renounced themselves, and would be found onely in Christ: Why then art thou such an enemy to thy true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, as to seek for a righteousnesse by thy own work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Though the people of God have works of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yet they have not righteousnesse of works. If then at any time thy heart be lifted up within thee, humble thy self with the thoughts of Christ; If this be so, then Christ was a Mediator in vain, he was made man in vain, &amp; died in vain: Can we think that Christ came into the world to share the glory of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation between man and himself? No, but as the Moral Law is, <hi>We are to have no other gods beside him;</hi> so the Gospel saith, We are to have no other Mediator but him: Oh then! if thou didst study Christ more, and convince thy self thorowly of the fulnesse and sufficiency that is in him, thou wouldst be restlesse and disquieted within thee, till thou wert centred on Christ; Thou wouldst be as <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, that found no set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place, when the waters covered the earth, till she got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ark.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. Another cause of self-justification, and refusing Christs
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:118921:99"/> righteousnesse, is, <hi>The deceit of subtil and crafty distinctions, which corrupt mindes have brought in,</hi> so that whereas they dared not immediately and grosly contradict <hi>Paul,</hi> who doth so professedly dispute against Justification by works, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent many plausible and specious distinctions, hiding defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ugly errours under fair disguises: So that what the Scripture saith of <hi>Absoloms</hi> battel with <hi>David, The wood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured more then then sword that day,</hi> the same may we say, The crooked windings and labyrinths of distinctions loose more souls then open grosse errours: Insomuch that they have so many glosses and fair colours, that the simple are easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, thinking all is well; but the Snake lieth hid under these sweet flowers; for when we do urge, That <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all works from Justification, and makes an immediate opposition between believing and working, so that he doth not admit of any <hi>medium;</hi> The Adversaries like <hi>Jezabel</hi> paint their faces, and look very boldly. Its true, say some, works are excluded, but such as are done by the meer power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, such are granted to be wilde grapes, and to have no sweetnesse in them, but the works that are done through grace they are not shut out. Others, Works are excluded, but not the works of the Moral Law, but the Ceremonial onely; they were not to seek Justification by Sacrifices and Circumcision, for now Christ was come, these were antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Others they draw a smaller line, and they say, Works are excluded, yea even the works of grace, but not as works, onely as merits; so that the working is not disputed against, but the merit of working, as if thereby heaven and glory might be demanded by way of debt. Again, Others they say, Works are excluded, but such works as are perfect and fully commensurated to the Law; by such no man can be justified, but through grace and a merciful condescension, our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect works are accepted of to our Justification. Thus you see by all these subtil distinctions, men would be thought not to thwart Scripture; Every one saith, <hi>Paul</hi> is not against me, the Scripture doth mean works in the sense as I mean, I say as the Scripture saith, and grant what that affirmeth. Now by these subtil insinuations, the simple is enticed, as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:118921:100"/> the <hi>adulterous woman, into dangerous nets, and is undone before he thinketh any thing.</hi> Take heed then of subtil and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse distinctions, think not to put off the great Judge of the world with them. Its as if a man should cover himself with cobwebs in the midst of a battel, thinking they will serve for a strong harnesse to defend him against all dangers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> A sixth cause of this pronenesse to our own righteousnesse rather then to Christs, is, <hi>From the sublimity and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturality of that way of Justification, which the Gospel hath revealed:</hi> So that it being several wayes supernatural, its no wonder if our hearts naturally do not close with it. As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Its supernatural in the revelation of the truth of it.</hi> Had not God revealed such a way of Justification, we should no more have thought of it, then of any other mystery in the Christian Religion: So that as from the Scriptures onely we come to know <hi>that there is a Trinity, that God became man, that our bodies shall rise again;</hi> Thus from them only we come to know, that we are justified, not by working, though by the most admirable and choice works that can be, but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Christ. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The righteousnesse of God</hi> is said <hi>to be revealed from faith to faith; Revealed</hi>] Therefore all the <hi>Aristotles</hi> and <hi>Platoes</hi> in the world never thought of such a way. This then is the cause so many look after a false Justification, and rest their souls upon an unsound and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten righteousnesse. The Gospel-righteousnesse, as it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Gods procuring, so its also of his revealing; and therefore as the other Doctrines of Christian Religion are above our reason, so is this also; we are as hardly perswaded of such a righteousnesse by Christ, as we are of Christ himself being God and man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The supernaturality of it is in the contrariety of it to flesh and bloud.</hi> The truth of it is not only above our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, but the practice of it is against our hearts. <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of integrity looked for Justification by works; so that this Gospel-justification is not onely opposite to man fallen, but man standing also. It was never in mans nature to seek for a Justification by a righteousnesse without us:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:118921:100"/> Now this contrariety of Gods Justification to our self-justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is, because in Gods way we are emptied of all things, we are discovered to be beggars, to be undone and damned in our selves; and the heart of man will never yield to this, till it be broken and contrite, in pieces, losing all its former fashion and figure. This Gospel-Justification being then both for the nature of it, and truth of it, wholly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, its no wonder so few have any discerning of it; they must be Eagle-eyed that can look into this Sunne. The Apostle <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.13. sheweth, that even a godly man while a babe, one that is in the beginnings of Christianity, is <hi>unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the word of righteousnesse, i. e.</hi> the Gospel, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth true righteousnesse; Therefore this is called <hi>strong meat,</hi> and fit for those who by reason of use, or an habit and perfection in holinesse have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil: Oh what a long while is it, ere the new convert is directed to this way of Justification! What perplexities? What troubles of heart? What sad tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations do befall him, and all because he is unskilful in this subject, and its the grown Christian who comes to have a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning spirit in it!</p>
                  <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">II. Another cause of mens prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to trust in a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of their own, is, A practical Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration of some neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to our actions.</note>
                     <hi>A practical Ignorance or Inconsideration of some necessary things relating to our actions, is the cause of prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to a false Justification, as well as a speculative ignorance of the fore-mentioned dogmatical points.</hi> If therefore a man did seriously attend to some such practical truths, as are to be mentioned, he would be as much afraid to abide in his own righteousnesse, as <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> when fire and brimstone were ready to devour. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Let him consider how great his omission is of the good things he should have done:</hi> Oh, who is able to abide, when he shall consider what this command and that required! What duty here and there he ought to have done, and yet failed many times? And certainly, if upon a supposition of doing all, we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> are commanded, to say, <hi>That we are unprofitable servants,</hi> God is not bettered, or made more happy by us, how much more when we neglect so many things we ought to do? Hence therefore when the Scripture speaks of the good works the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:118921:101"/> godly have done, yea when they are mentioned to their praise, yet mercy and forgivenesse is at the same time desired. Thus when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> reckoned up the great acts of service he did for God, yet saith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Remember me, O my God, and spare me, according to the greatnesse of thy mercy.</hi> So concerning <hi>Onesiphorus,</hi> who was truly according to his name <hi>Onesiphorus</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.16, 18. for he oft refreshed him, was not ashamed of <hi>Pauls</hi> chain, yea sought him out very diligently, yet what saith <hi>Paul? The Lord shew mercy, and the Lord grant he may finde mercy of the Lord in that day.</hi> You would think <hi>Paul</hi> had spoken of some great sinnes of <hi>Onesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> before; No, but he speaks of his eminent and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable graces, and yet prayeth thus heartily for mercy which alwayes supposeth misery: If therefore at any time thy heart begins to be lifted up within thee, because thus and thus thou hast done, Oh check thy self with the omission of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thou oughtest to have done: Who is able to hold up his head if God remember the neglect of this and that duty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee? This consideration will make us to mention Gods righteousnesse only, and that with great vehemency and assurance of soul, as you have it notably expressed, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.25. <hi>In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory;</hi> The seed of <hi>Israel</hi> is there the spiritual seed, the chosen ones of God, these shall be justified in the Lord, not in their own graces or works they do, and there is the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of this, They shall glory, which could never be, if Justification were to be by our own works, for then we had matter rather of shame and confusion within our selves. And further observe, whereas at <hi>vers.</hi> 23. its said, <hi>Every knee should bow unto God, and tongue swear by him,</hi> The main mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein his worship is seen, is, <hi>Surely, shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousnesse.</hi> This truth of having righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse onely in the Lord, hath such a powerful influence upon every godly man, that he shall swear it, and in his worship of God (which is <hi>Synechdochically</hi> expressed by swearing.) This will be the great stay and comfort of his soul, that in God only consists all his righteousnesse.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A second thing in our practical miscarriage, whereby we
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:118921:101"/> idolize our own righteousnesse, is, <hi>The not considering that if we do any good at any time, its not by our own power, or own strength, but wholly by the grace of God:</hi> So that we cannot be justified by this, but rather thereby our own impotency is the more discovered, as is well observed by Mr. <hi>Bradshaw</hi> in his little Treatise of Justification, That the more we are enabled by grace to do any thing, the more supernatural help we have, the lesse are we justified in our selves. Hence the Scripture when it speaks of our Justification alwayes expresseth it <hi>passively;</hi> we are justified never <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,</hi> unlesse in an ill sense, as <hi>Luke</hi> 16. when the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> are said to <hi>justifie themselves.</hi> Thus <hi>Durand</hi> of old well argued, That by no works of Grace could we me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, because the more Grace we had, there was the more obligation of thankfulnesse to God, we received more gifts from God; So that in the very doing of any good, we ought to be humbled; For from whom comes this power? Who giveth thee this assistance? Let not then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pride, like a dead flie in the box of ointment spoil all. It was the expression of an ancient Writer, As those that draw up pure water, sometimes have frogs come up with the water that make it loathsome: Thus many that are imployed in heavenly and great works of God, as the Spirit of God is working in them, so their own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane spirit, and corrupt principles co-operate therewith, and thus the comfort of a duty is lost: As the <hi>Pharisees did all to be seen of men, and so they had their reward,</hi> that was their punishment and their judgement, to have that glory from men, which they wholly looked after: If therefore at any time thou art enabled to <hi>believe</hi> or <hi>repent,</hi> know in this thou doest not give to God, but God gives thee: So that its a pernicious Doctrine which <hi>Socinus</hi> teacheth, <hi>Tract. de Justific.</hi> That in Justification, the main thing is to look to those things that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, not without us. If this were so, then <hi>Paul</hi> was fouly mistaken, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. <hi>who would not be found in his own righteousnesse, but that which is through faith in Christ.</hi> Certainly, the clean contrary is most true, That
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:118921:102"/> in Justification we are to look more to that which is without us then within us; we are to live spiritually, as we do naturally, as naturally we live by receiving in breath from without; So we spiritually live by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in righteousnesse through Christ: If then all be of Grace, then Justification is not from or by any thing we do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, We do not practically attend to this also, <hi>That when we are inabled by Grace to do any thing that is good, yet as this gracious Action cometh through our hands, it admits of much soyl and imperfection.</hi> Some have thought it blasphemy to say, The gracious Actions we are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled unto by Gods Spirit, are imperfect; As if (say they) Gods Spirit did any thing imperfectly, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that <hi>Paul</hi> (Philip. 3.) though he had the Spirit of God dwelling in him, yet accounts all that he did, as <hi>dung and drosse</hi> comparatively to Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Besides, Though the Spirit of God worketh these things in us, yet it is not made one person with us; it doth onely efficiently produce them, not vitally and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally. The Spirit of God doth not believe or repent, though it enableth us to those things; as naturally its not God that eateth, or drinketh, or moveth in us, though by his assistance we are enabled to do all. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, its a known Rule, That <hi>Quicquid recipitur, recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad modum recipientis;</hi> Pure water running thorow a foul Pipe, getteth some soil upon it; Excellent Wine will taste of the Cask, if it be not sweet: So that, although the same Action as it cometh from God be perfect, yet as it floweth from us, is vitiated and made imperfect several wayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Men do not practically attend to this, <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, That by the Grace of God thou doest that which is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, yea that is absolutely and perfectly so, yet this is not enough to the Law, because that requireth the universall frame of all good works commanded.</hi> As the Apostle <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>He that breaks one is guilty of all.</hi> Its an usual saying, The Law of God is copulative, that is, it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:118921:102"/> the connexion and chaining of all duties together; so that if a man were able to perform one or two good duties in a most absolute manner, yet unlesse he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in all, he had not the righteousnesse of the Law. <hi>Socinus (Tract. de Justificat.)</hi> grants that the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. excludeth works of Justification, not onely as merits, but as they are works; onely he saith, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle means by workes the whole <hi>congeries</hi> or order of all good duties required by the Law, and thus none is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified; but then, he saith, the Apostle <hi>James</hi> when he attributeth Justification to works, he doth not take works for the universal observance of all Gods commands, but but for the frequent and constant use of them, though accompanied with several failings and omissions: But this will not heal the wound he hath made. Although we grant, That if a man could perfectly and compleatly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law of God in some particular command, yet unlesse there were a general observation of all, there could not be any subsisting before God: Attend not then to some few particular duties done, though never so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and exactly, for unlesse thou art able to say, Thou hast kept all, and failed not in any one particular, here cannot be any Justification by works.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If men did practically consider not onely the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                     <hi>Omission of many good things, but the commission of many sinnes daily, this would make them flie out of their selves to a Justification by Christ:</hi> For if there be but one sinne that may be laid to thy charge, though all thy other life for the future were as perfect as that of the Saints and Angels in Heaven, it could not avail to Justification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that one sinne in the guilt of it would preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and weigh down all thy duties, one sinne would be more to condemn, then all thy holinesse to save thee, and this is the ground why it behoved us to have such an <hi>High-Priest,</hi> that was altogether <hi>without spot,</hi> or <hi>ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,</hi> because if he had sinnes of his own, he could not have satisfied for another: What madnesse then and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:118921:103"/> blindenesse doth possesse men, that they should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to set up that for a covering, which will indeed be like so many sparks of fire to consume them, like so many bryers to tear and rend them? They do in this matter of Justification, as the Jews in their calamities, run from one refuge to another, from a Serpent to a wall tottering that would fall upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Lastly, Men do not consider, <hi>That when they have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained from sinne, that it hath been many times not out of love to God, or hatred to sinne, but either because the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity hath not been, or else outward fear and shame, and if so, thou art farre from a Justification by this.</hi> The <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> many times in their afflictions were kept from sinne, but it was something without kept them, as the bounds of the Sea keep in the waters, it was not from any true sanctified principle within: So that if any one do but think of all these particulars, they will quickly melt within, and be afraid of themselves, they will cry out, Woe be unto me in my best condition: What the <hi>Psalmist</hi> said, <hi>Every man at his best is but vanity;</hi> The same they will say even of their spiritual condition; and what the Prophet said, <hi>All flesh is grasse, and the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof fadeth away,</hi> The same in some sense, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Justification, they may speak: Even their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Graces are as grosse, and fade away, when the scorching beams of the glorious Sunne of Righteousnesse shall appear. More causes may be discovered of our prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be our own Justifiers and Saviours, but they will come in opportunely hereafter.</p>

                  <p>I answer, Even therefore thou needest all things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou needest a Justification without thee, because thou thinkest it is within thee: Oh man to be pitied and wept over!

                  <p>WE are pursuing the Negative part, or, <hi>What is that Righteousnesse whereby we are not Justified.</hi> For this general introductory hath been dispatched, That men are very propense to establish their own righteousnesse in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to that which God hath procured: And here in the Text we see a peremptory and universal exclusion of all men in the world, if considered in their natural estate from such a righteousnesse, as may justifie them before God. For whereas the Apostle distributeth all mankinde into <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> he sheweth they are both alike impotent and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the matter of Justification: For although at <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2. he saith, The <hi>Jews</hi> advantage is much every way, in respect of the <hi>Gentile,</hi> yet he doth not at <hi>vers.</hi> 9. contradict himself, when he saith, the <hi>Jew</hi> is in no wise better then the <hi>Gentile;</hi> for in the former verses he speaks of Church-priviledges and visible Prerogatives, wherein the <hi>Jew</hi> highly transcended the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:118921:104"/>
                     <hi>Gentile;</hi> but at the 9<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
                     <hi>verse,</hi> he compareth them together in the great businesse of Justification, and then the <hi>Jew</hi> with all his worship and knowledge of the <hi>Law,</hi> is no better then an ignorant unbeleeving <hi>Gentile.</hi> As mountains and high hils may seem great, if compared to the valleys, but if with the heavens, then the hils and valleys are but as a <hi>punctum,</hi> and all is nothing to them: Even the prophane man that is accounted of as a dunghill, and a formal Justiciary, that is admired as a Saint, yet in respect of Justification are both naked and miserable alike, for in Gods sight no man is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any works he doth.</p>
                  <p>Now that both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> are both alike in respect of Justification, the divine Apostle saith, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>That he had proved it before.</hi> The word is observed by the learned never to signifie to <hi>prove a thing,</hi> but rather to <hi>accuse</hi> and <hi>charge,</hi> to <hi>make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,</hi> and thus it best agreeth here; and the Indictment drawn up against the whole world, even all men of all sorts, is, <hi>That they are under sinne,</hi> both in the condemning power of it, and also the reigning power of it; <hi>Ʋnder it,</hi> which denoteth the weight or load of sinne; <hi>Ʋnder it,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth sinnes dominion, and their slavery unto it; <hi>Ʋnder it,</hi> so that they are unable to shake off the tyranny of it: Oh that as the <hi>Israelites</hi> could humble themselves and mourn, when they were under their oppressours, and servants ruled over them; So we could as spiritually prostrate our selves before God, because of the yoke sinne hath put upon us! for we cannot say of sinnes yoke, as <hi>Christ</hi> of his, <hi>that it is easie and light:</hi> Or if it be so for a while, yet at last the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den will be intolerable, making thee to tremble and cry out with <hi>Cain, My sinnes are greater then I can bear.</hi> This charge which the Apostle laid upon all mankinde, he doth again in the verses following at large prove; for there is nothing so necessary to the diseased person, as to see the danger of his disease: Its the beginning of our heavenly cure, to be strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of our undone estate: And that the Apostle may not seem to speak out of particular malice, or as if he were some churlish <hi>Misanthropos,</hi> he brings <hi>Scripture</hi> for what he saith, <hi>As it is written.</hi> Now you must know that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:118921:105"/> the verses alledged are from many places in Scripture, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 53. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. &amp; <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the vulgar Edition all these are added in <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. yet by the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves, <hi>Pererius</hi> and <hi>Sasbont,</hi> its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed they are not in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> nor in the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and <hi>Pererius in loc.</hi> doth well reprove <hi>Lindanus</hi> that would from hence prove the <hi>Hebrew</hi> corrupted by the Jews, for why should they do it in this place, when it related not to <hi>Christ?</hi> it being only moral matter, and that which is in other places of Scripture. From all these places joyned together, we may see what a loathsome leper all mankinde is, that the whole world is an hospitall of <hi>Lazarusses</hi> of diseased ulcerous persons. Its good for every one to meditate on them, for none is excluded. Their corruption is set down, first, <hi>Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally,</hi> then <hi>particularly,</hi> or by induction of parts, and that <hi>negatively</hi> and <hi>positively: negatively,</hi> by denying the graces of the soul, of the minde, <hi>none understands God;</hi> of the heart and will, <hi>there is none that seeketh after God;</hi> of the body, <hi>They all turned aside,</hi> which universal sentence is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by sinnes of words, expressed by their instruments, of <hi>throat, tongue, lips and mouths.</hi> Their sinnes of works are expressed <hi>Synecdochically</hi> by the Ministry and service of their <hi>feet,</hi> with the effects of them; all which sinnes are illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a two-fold cause, the fountain of all, want of love to their neighbour, <hi>The way of peace, they have not known,</hi> and want of fear to God, <hi>There is no fear of God before their eyes:</hi> So that here you have a most admirable and lively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of man by nature; you see what a beast, what a toad, what a devil he is. Where are they that will advance free-will, plead for the purity of nature, and deny original sinne? This is a true faithfull looking-glasse to represent every one in, for the words are universal and emphatical, <hi>There is none righteous, no not one.</hi> Let no man plead an exemption, and think he is not within the compasse of this charge, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the difficulty is, in what sense to explain this; and some there are that take these expressions in an hyperbolical sense, not that every one was thus unrighteous, but because the generality was corrupted. But this cannot stand with the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:118921:105"/> Apostles scope, which is to shew, that all mankinde was <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sinne,</hi> and could not be justified by <hi>works;</hi> Therefore if any were excluded from such an indictment, these persons would be justified by works, and so the Apostles inference would not hold <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Others they say, <hi>None is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, i. e.</hi> to such a perfect, absolute righteousnesse, as the Law requireth. Others, <hi>None is righteous, i. e.</hi> so as not to commit some sinne or other sometimes. But that which is most genuine is, that the Apostle here speaketh of what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is by nature, that he is thus positively and negatively miserable, as soon as he hath a being; for although the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle reckons up actual sinnes, and such as every one doth not commit, yet because the inclination and propensity of all are to such wickednesse, and its not because they are born with lesse defilement then others, or have more innocent natures then others, but because God puts bounds to mans sins, and he restraineth even where he doth not sanctifie. Therefore the expression is universal; As we say, All Toads and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents are poisonous, though actually they have not poisoned any. The sense therefore is, That <hi>none is righteous,</hi> both in respect of Sanctification, because by nature full of sinne, and in respect of Justification, and so are not able to endure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the consuming presence of an holy God. To clear this truth, consider</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That God made man righteous,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. God made man righteous.</note>
                     <hi>he was created like the glorious heavens, there was no spot or blemish in him.</hi> Had man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde continued in that integrity, then the contrary would have been true, <hi>There is none unrighteous, no not one.</hi> The Image of God is said to be in righteousnesse and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.29. <hi>God made man upright, but he hath sought out many inventions.</hi> As therefore now since man is fallen, the Apostle shutteth out the righteousnesse of works; so if he had stood, the righteousnesse of faith had been excluded. The condition then we were created in, was as full of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse as the heavens of starres, then man approached to God as absolutely considered, there was no necessity of a Mediatour, or an atonement: yet though this was so happy an estate, Divines conclude, that our estate of reparation
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:118921:106"/> is more blessed then that of integrity; not only in respect of duration, for <hi>Adam</hi> totally lost his happinesse, but so shall not the believer; but also in respect of that righteousnesse, whereby he stands justified before God, for though <hi>Adams</hi> righteousnesse was inherent and perfect, not stained with the least sinne, yet it was a creature-righteousnesse: But ours, though imputed, and not in our selves, feeling ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imperfections, yet its the righteousnesse of Christ, God and man. Our Justification then is as full of soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, comfort and joy, as <hi>Adams</hi> in integrity, yea it far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends it.<note place="margin">2. But he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost it.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Though God created man with a righteousnesse, yet he presently lost it, both for himself, and for all his posterity, so that there is not a righteousnesse to be had by any man living.</hi> There is not naturally any such thing in the world: What thunder and lightning should this be in our ears? Every man by nature is in an unjustified estate by God, and that inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all misery, as Justification doth all happinesse: if not justified, <hi>God is angry with thee all the day long.</hi> Thou hast no peace with God or thy own conscience; thy chamber, thy bed must alwayes be an hell to thee; thou art cursed with all the curses of the Law: Therefore though for the present thou wallowest in thy pleasures and lusts; Thou eatest, and drinkest, and runnest into all excesse of riot. Yet there is nothing but condemnation belongs to thee: Oh that men had hearts to consider and tremble at this! How canst thou live a day, yea moment without Justification? Thou art na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and exposed to all the vengeance of God, will not this make thee eat the bread of trembling, and drink the water of astonishment? This righteousnesse is lost; Thou hast no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but rags and filth upon thee. God and thy soul are at a vast distance, yea and direct contrariety: Oh that men should not think all other miseries, though never so extream, to be but small in respect of this want of a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse! Yet we can complain under the want of food to nourish us, of cloaths to cover us; but who goeth wringing the hands; and bowed down with the head, crying out, I have no righteousnesse to stand with before God?</p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:118921:106"/>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Yet there is an absolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of having a righteousnes.</note>
                     <hi>Though man hath lost a righteousnesse to be justified by, yet there is an absolute necessity of having one.</hi> God cannot love or delight in any thing but righteousnesse: You have heard how holy, pure and righteous God is, and therefore loveth only such as are righteous, if our prayers and duties be not the performances of righteous persons, God loathes them, whosoever is not according to his holy will, he utterly rejects it, he turneth his eyes from it: Oh that people would meditate on this more! They say, Let us go to the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, let us pray and hear; but they never think, Where is the righteousnesse that I must put on to make me accepted? Like the man in the Parable, they venture to come to the feast, though they have not a wedding garment: Men naturally think their holy duties are their righteousnes, &amp; they come to do these, expecting thereby to be justified; but oh thy vain and deceived heart! Thy duties are not thy righteousnesse; but thou needest a righteousnesse to cover the deformities of them, and to make them accepted. <hi>Abels</hi> person must first be accepted before his offering can be: So that the Sunne is not more necessary for the eye to discern objects, or the air for men to live by, then a righteousnesse is to do all holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties acceptably in Gods sight. <hi>So that this righteousnesse is to be sought in the first place, without this we build without a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, we cannot proceed one step in Christianity without this covering.</hi> But as the hand full of earth or drosse cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive gold; so a man filled with the thoughts and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of his own righteousnesse, cannot look out for the true righteousnesse: All our conditions are like the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Revel. 3.17, 18. <hi>Who thought her self rich and needed nothing, when indeed she was poor and miserable:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she is <hi>counselled to buy eye-salve, and to get raiments to cloathe her nakednesse with.</hi> This is all our conditions, we think our selves full, when we are empty; we judge all well, when if we knew what we are, we should nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sleep nor eat,<note place="margin">Why no man by nature hath a righteousnes to be justified before God.</note> for the wretchednesse we feel our selves in.</p>

By this we are <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath,</hi> though we had never committed any actual transgression. By this it is, that God is justified in the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Heathens, yea and their Infants also, though they never heard of Christ, or enjoyed the means of grace; How
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:118921:107"/> then can they by nature have a righteousnesse to justifie, who are full of sinne to condemn? How can they be children of grace who are children of wrath? And truly, he onely will build upon the rock, who diggeth thus deep, even to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of nature defilement; and because this is spiritually discovered, as you see by <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. hence the number of those is very few that are able to put a due price upon the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> and his righteousnesse. He that would make the way plain for Christ, must beginne with the true sense of the depth, breadth and length of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal sinne; here it is true, <hi>That one deep cals upon another;</hi> The depth of original sin for the depth of Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As men are thus wholly become leprous and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> so by this defilement they are obnoxious to Gods wrath.</hi> There is no more in them then in devils, why they should be justified; See what the <hi>Apostle</hi> inferreth from this large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of their natural pollution, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>That every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God.</hi> All the world is guilty, <gap reason="foreign">

We think not that we came into the world so many condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed persons, that every hour all the sentence of wrath may passe upon us.

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>No man naturally hath a righteousnesse to be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by, because if he abstain from committing any sinne, its not from right and holy grounds, and if he do that which is for the substance good, yet it is not from pure ends.</hi> We suppose that if a man by nature have a righteousnesse to be justified by, it must be from something within him; it must be either innate or acquired. Now if we look over all men by nature, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:118921:108"/> finde not one man, no not doing one action, thereby to be accepted of by God: so that if God should make a more condescending profer in this case, then he did in the matter of <hi>Sodome</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> it could not obtain an effect. Should God say, If among all mankinde considered in and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, you can finde fifty righteous actions, I will pardon all mankinde for them, fifty could not be found; yea if the Lord should descend from fifty to ten, yet mankinde could not be helped. Nay, should we go further, then <hi>Abraham</hi> thought fit, If amongst all mankinde can be found one righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous action, it shall be justified; yet in this case, though all mankinde did lie at the stake, there could not be any help found for it; for if sinne be not committed, no man natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can do it from principles of faith and love, or from the renewed Image of God within; its because he wants the opportunity, or some outward restraint is upon him. Was <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> the lesse guilty, because when he stretched out the arm to hurt the Prophet, that immediately withered, and so he could not accomplish his wicked design? Thus it is with all men naturally, they have the seed of all wickednesse in them; every one would be a <hi>Judas,</hi> a <hi>Cain,</hi> only God that bounds the Sea that it doth not overflow the banks, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so limit and bound the wickednesse of natural men. Thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so if they do what is good, the Lord doth not account it to them for righteousnesse, because they never can do any thing to its true and ultimate end, as <hi>Augustine</hi> often. It was vain glory which made them perform most of their noble imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and if they did any good action for its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular end, as relieve the necessitous from a compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natenesse to mans misery, yet they come short of the universal end, which is Gods glory; so that whatsoever doth not ascend as high as this, is to be judged but <hi>splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didum peccatum,</hi> a glistering sinne, and so cannot justifie before God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>No man can naturally be justified before God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> he is born destitute of the knowledge of God, and faith in Christ.</hi> Now <hi>John</hi> 17.2. <hi>Its eternal life to know God, and Christ</hi> sent as the Mediatour; and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Without faith its

And so our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.18. affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <hi>That a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit, and that therefore the tree must first be good before any fruit can be good.</hi> Now its plain, all men by nature are corrupted Trees, they are bitter fountains, they are a wilde stock, till ingraffed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ: yea <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.14. <hi>They are all over impure and unclean, and thereby every thing becomes unclean to them:</hi> Oh then, Where are they that admire and plead for mans righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by nature, when the Scripture represents him thus loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and abominable! But this defilement is not onely on his person, it redounds and overfloweth to all that he doth; so that a dung-hill may as well cleanse, or pitch may make white, as a man by nature be justified; and from hence it is, that <hi>Augustine</hi> of old, and our <hi>Protestant Writers</hi> of late maintain against <hi>Papists,</hi> That all the works of Heathens, yea of unbelievers, and unregenerate men, are sinnes; There is not one good action to be found amongst them, which though it may seem a cruel and bloody opinion thus at one blow to make the condition of all mankinde with the most glorious actions, to be hopelesse; yet it is no more then what the Scripture is plain for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>Without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to please God,</hi> so that all men naturally being destitute of faith, are not able to please God in any thing; If they eat, if they drink, yea if they pray, if they come to the Ordinances, in none of these things are they pleasing to God. That fore-mentioned place, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. doth evince this, <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure;</hi> All their natural, civil and religious actions are made unclean to them; for their civil actions of their calling, even that which is thought to be most innocent and harmlesse, yet that is said to be a sin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.4. <hi>The plowing of the wicked is sinne;</hi> he doth not say, his merchandizing, his buying and selling, wherein may be much fraud and injustice, but <hi>his plowing</hi> that is sinne, How so? It cannot be from the matter of the action, for that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:118921:110"/> is good and lawful, but from the condition that the natural person is in; he being corrupted, there cometh also a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all his actions; As the plague and pestilence may be conveyed in the sent or smell, though even to the very gold and silver that infected persons have: Oh what confusion should be upon thee, to consider that all the day long, thy works, thy imployments have been so much constant sinning against God! Not onely thy prophanenesse, thy oaths, thy curses, but thy sowing, thy mowing, thy buying, thy sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; Thus the number of thy sinnes ariseth higher and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then ever thou thoughtst of. So true is that of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm, Omnis vita infidelium peccatum est, &amp; nihil bonum sine summo bono,</hi> yea their religious actions in which they are apt to put all their confidence, and rest on them as the sure ground of their salvation, they are all so many sinnes as flowing from them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.27. <hi>The Sacrifice of the wicked is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord.</hi> See here how God accounts of the religious duties of unregenerate men, <hi>they are an abomination;</hi> This word is used to shew the highest disdain and displeasure God can have, and therefore commonly in the Scripture <hi>Idols</hi> are called <hi>Abominations.</hi> Thus even the choisest and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent religious duties of any unbeliever, are an abomination to God, and can that which is an abomination justifie? Can that which God hateth, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. with the like hatred he doth all the grossest sinnes that are? Can these reconcile God? Oh be at last convinced! Thy religious duties do not sanctifie thy defiled person, but thy defiled person polluteth thy religious duties. This truth was lively represented under the Old Testament, by the <hi>legal uncleannesse:</hi> if a person so guilty medled with any holy things, they did not take away his uncleannesse, but he defiled them; And to this purpose the Prophet <hi>Haggie</hi> doth notably speak, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.12, 13, 14. <hi>If a man that was unclean did touch holy things, those holy things were made unclean by him.</hi> There is not scarce any truth more fundamentally necessary to make way for Christ, and highly to esteem Justification, then this; when thou shalt consider, that all the day long thou art damning thy self, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou doest, eat or drink, work or pray, all is unclean to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:118921:110"/> thee; for what will amaze and astonish thee if this do not? Thou wilt see thy self like <hi>Peters</hi> sheet, full of unclean things, and if any thing, this surely will make thee afraid of thy self, and seek out for spiritual relief through Christ. I am unwilling to leave this truth, till every one be practically and cordially convinced of it: Till this foundation be laid, in vain do we build up any thing of Gospel-Justification, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take some salt to season the former truth; When we say, <hi>That no men by nature are able to do the least righteous or good action,</hi> though the salvation of all mankinde doth depend on it.</p>
                  <p>This is not to be understood, as if we put no difference between the actions unbelievers do, that it is all one whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an unregenerate man did pray or commit adultery, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did outward acts of Justice, or be full of violence and rapine; No such matter is intended: only we say, Their actions may be divided into two kinds; some of them are in their nature vicious and sinful, as to lie, steal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others are for the matter and substance of them good, onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of circumstances, and other requisite conditions, they become sinnes: As if an unregenerate man walk justly and righteously to his neighbour, relieve a man in necessity, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his parents, or preserve the publick good before his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, as many <hi>Romans</hi> did. These actions for the nature of them were good and commanded, but because they failed in many other things, therefore they were sinnes as to them; for the old Rule is, <hi>Malum is ex quolibet defectum,</hi> any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect makes an action so farre sinful, but <hi>Bonum est ex integri causis,</hi> good must be of all its causes: Goodnesse is like har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious musick, if any one string jarre the harmony is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Its like beauty compleated of the symmetry of all the parts, if any one part be deformed, the beauty is vitiated, and thus it is in all good actions, let any thing be never so admirable for the nature of it, <hi>To give thy body to be burnt,</hi> or to suffer Martyrdom, if there be any failing or crack ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the principle, manner or end; Thou hast lost the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and the reward of the duty. And thus all men natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they cannot but be defective in these things,</p>

                  <p>And then lastly, they notoriously misse of the <hi>glorious end,</hi> to which every action ought ultimately to relate, and that is <hi>God</hi> himself: So that from these particulars it is, that no man improved to the utmost in his natural abilities can procure a righteousnesse to be justified by.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Yea I shall adde a third Proposition or demonstration of mans utter impotency in respect of Justification, <hi>That he is so farre from having a righteousnesse out of his own bowels to cloath himself with, as the Silk-worm makes her curious web, that he cannot in the least manner dispose or prepare himself thereunto.</hi> He cannot do any thing, whereby either to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or to oblige God to bestow Justification upon him, which must needs stop every mans mouth. It cannot be denied but that there are ordinarily preparatory works upon the soul in order to Justification, such as conviction of sinne, sense and feeling of the burden of it, general desires to have some ease; but yet these are neither preparations of mans own strength or power; Neither are they so much as meritorious <hi>de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruo</hi> of Justification; yea they are not necessary antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, for how many have such works upon their souls, have many troubles and anxieties of heart, and yet never obtain this glorious priviledge of Justification: So that its plain, no man by his natural strength can any wayes prepare or fit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for this mercy. Howsoever the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Doctrine to be worthy of an <hi>Anathema,</hi> yet they might as well have condemned the Scripture it self. Its true, they suppose an Heathen improving his naturals well, for
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:118921:111"/> which God will reveal supernaturals and wonderfully make known Christ and Salvation to him, but when they are desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to produce any such one Heathen, they can do it no more then the <hi>Chymist</hi> his Philosophers stone; so that Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication alwayes findes a man unworthy of that favour, yea it meeteth with him in a state wholly opposite to it; and whereas the sinner might justly have looked for damnation, he obtaineth Salvation: So that every justified person hath greater cause to melt under the favour of God, then <hi>Saul</hi> under <hi>Davids</hi> had, when yet that wretched man could not but weep to see <hi>David</hi> spare him, though his great enemy, when he had the opportunity to cut him off: Oh how justly may the soul melt with thankfulnesse! saying, Oh Lord! Shall all this goodnesse of thine be shewed to me an enemy? What, not only delivered from hell and all punishment, but admitted also to those eternal joyes in heaven? Who can but be amazed at this? Hence the Scripture alwayes attributeth our Justification to the free grace of God, diligently exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any works we can do; and certainly if in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Justification, that be alwayes retained by meer grace, so that no works of ours, though regenerated, and endowed with an heavenly principle within, are causal of it, How much rather are men impotent and undeserving, while abiding under the power of sinne, and no wayes able, but to do every thing in a sinful manner?</p>
                  <p>These things may suffice to witnesse this truth against all mankinde, and let the Scripture be true, though every man be a sinner; yet though Gods word doth thus plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base man, as to the point of Justification, There are many that cannot digest this; They will never be perswaded that they are thus all over plunged into sin; What, do nothing, and that all the day long, <hi>but treasure up wrath against the day of wrath?</hi> Who can bear this Doctrine? Yea there are those that revile this Doctrine, as making God very unmerciful and cruel, damning the farre greater part of mankinde with their little Infants also in eternal flames, because they believe not in a Christ, of whom many never heard. There are therefore those that have stood up, and pleaded the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:118921:112"/> case, and said, <hi>That they may be justified and saved only by the knowledge of God as a Creator, if so be they walk honestly according to that light they have:</hi> Hence they have asserted a Judaical and Ethnical piety, as well as a Christian, and grant a Justification and a Salvation even without a visible Church.</p>
                  <p>Not to speak of the Hereticks <hi>Rhetoriani</hi> of old, to which many of late have joined themselves, who dogmatized, <hi>That every one might be saved in any one way of Religion, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so opposite to another.</hi>

                     </gap> because he followeth Christ, (who (say they) is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> because he enlightens every man with reason that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world.</p>
                  <p>Others they grant, Such as are saved have some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, but an implicite not explicite; They have a readinesse of heart to beleeve whatsoever God shall make known to them, though as yet nothing of Christ is expresly manifested to them.</p>
                  <p>In Antiquity, the two that are most famously instanced in for this opinion, are <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome;</hi> The former affirming, That Philosophy did by it self justifie the Heathens, and that what the Law was to the Jews, the Gospel to Christians, the same Philosophy was to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> And as for <hi>Chrysostom</hi> he saith, To know God, was once enough to salvation, but now its necessary to believe in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the opinion of these Ancients, we may reade <hi>Causabon Ex.</hi> 1<seg rend="sup">a</seg>
                     <hi>in Baron.</hi> who is positive, That they did hold salvation to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> without the knowledg of Christ. But the learned <hi>Vostius Thess. de vict. Gent.</hi> dissents, and makes a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:118921:112"/> moderate construction of their words; So also doth <hi>Sixtus Senensis (lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Annot.</hi> 51.) a learned Papist concerning <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom.</hi> Howsoever this be, its certain that we are naturally very prone to think of the mercy of God so illimited as to reach to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Augustine</hi> speaks the heart of every man in this point, <hi>Ep.</hi> 99. <hi>Virtutes Gentilium, quadam indole animi ita delectant, ut eos in quibus haec fuerunt vellemus praecipuè ab inferni cruciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus liberari, nisi aliter se haberet sensus humanus aliter justitia Creatoris,</hi> The virtues of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> do so naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light us, that with all our hearts we would they might be preserved from hell torments, did not an humane sense judge one thing, and the justice of a Creator another. In this point therefore we are to lay aside all humane reason and natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, attending to Gods word onely.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Remonstrants</hi> in this Question would suspend, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man might hold the affirmative from a principle of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration to mankinde. <hi>Vives</hi> and <hi>Erasmus</hi> are propense to this. Hence <hi>Erasmus Praef. ad Tull. Offic.</hi> placeth <hi>Tully</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, a place so full of glory, that neither Papists or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants have dared to set <hi>Erasmus</hi> himself there. <hi>Andradius</hi> the Papist did with great animosity plead for the Justification and Salvation of Heathens, whom <hi>Chemnitius</hi> solidly refuteth. So also <hi>Barlaeus,</hi> against whom <hi>Vedellius</hi> wrote that Book, stiled <hi>De Deo Synagogae.</hi> Now although the Apostle say, <hi>What have we to do to judge those that are without?</hi> yet that doth not hinder, but that we may positively determine, that by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, there is no Justification or Salvation without the Church. And therefore, though some Heathens have sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Christians by their morality, and have transcended in many practical perfections, yet we cannot say, That thereby they are justified, which hath been already abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, partly from original sinne, and partly from that spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al impurity thereby cleaving to their persons and actions, as also, because they are without faith, without which there cannot be any acceptation. We grant indeed that many who were not of the visible Church, have been justified, as <hi>Job, Melchisedech,</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> midwives, and <hi>Rahab,</hi> with
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:118921:113"/> many others. But we say, these had the means of grace one way or other vouchsafed to them, and so were instructed in the true knowledge of God, and thereby were made of the Church. Again, We grant a different degree in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and Christ. Some have more explicite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge then others, and God requireth of some a greater measure of knowledge then others, according to the means of grace they do enjoy; yet we say, That none can be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or saved without the knowledge of God and Christ in some measure or degree; And to the former Arguments, we may adde these Texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13, 14. where first its said, <hi>Whosoever shall call on the Name of the Lord, shall be saved.</hi> Now lest it might be thought Heathens and Pagans, they can pray to God, they can call on him, he addeth, this is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable praying, <hi>For how shall they call on him, if they do not believe? And how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard?</hi> &amp;c. Where you see plainly a connexion between acceptable prayers and faith, as also between faith and the Ministry. Another pregnant Text is, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. <hi>There is no other way of salvation, or name under heaven by which we can be saved, but by the name of Christ.</hi> The name of Christ is Christ known and believed, and there is no other way: So that Heathens cannot be justified one way, and Christians another; For as they that hold the contrary say, The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God as a Creator is necessary to Justification, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they could not walk thankfully, or consider their duty, the same is to be said concerning Christ also; and certainly if righteousnesse could have come to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by nature, Christ died in vain, was a Mediator in vain, as also the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Ministry is in vain, seeing absolutely Justification might have been had without them. There is one place much instanced in for the contrary, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. concerning <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Centurion, an Heathen souldier; now before he believed in Christ as the <hi>Messias,</hi> God saith of him, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.</hi> And <hi>Peter v.</hi> 35. saith, <hi>In every Nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteousnesse, is accepted of him.</hi> But the answer is, That this <hi>Cornelius,</hi> as also the <hi>Ethiopian Eunuch,</hi> they were not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:118921:113"/> Heathens, they had heard of Christ, and so had the initials of faith already begun in them, although they were directed where to have more full and clearer knowledge; and none can fear God or work righteousnesse, but he that hath the seminals of faith, and the principles of regeneration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him. Although we also adde, That there is a two-fold acceptation, 1. General, whereby God as a Creator doth accept of his creature, and mercifully provide many favours for them, and upon their humiliations, though not truly sanctified, release temporal punishments, as we see in <hi>Ahab,</hi> and many others. And secondly, There is a gracious acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance, thereby to ordain to eternal life, to justifie and to become reconciled with their persons; This is onely within the Church, and to those therein that truly fear God.</p>

Never did the poor cripple lie with more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse and vehemency, expecting the Angels descent into the pool, then thou art to wait for the grace of God to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie thee: Oh consider how dreadful it is, to stay a day, a night, a moment in an unjustified condition: for while so, thou hast no peace with God, go from one place to another, still the sentence of condemnation is upon thee! As the <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians</hi> found all their waters turned into bloud, they could not go to brooks, or rivers, or cisterns, but still all was bloud: So it is here, all is damnable matter, whether thou eatest or drinkest, whether thou labourest or sleepest, all turns to hell: Oh that men would believe this! How restlesse and unquiet would they be till being justified they had peace with God?</p>

                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>GAL. 3.11.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                     <q>But that no man is Justified by the Law in the sight of God, it is evident: For the Just shall live by Faith.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>IN this Epistle the Apostle vindicateth two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Ministry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The true Doctrine about <hi>Justification</hi> against that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt errour broached by false teachers; that the Law, or the works of it, were either in part or in whole requisite to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, that Christ himself was not sufficient to Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without this additament. In the confuting of which dangerous errour, he is full of strong Arguments, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all observed to be more severe and sharp in his words, then in any other Epistle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> relateth, <hi>Prolog. in Epist. Gal.</hi>) thought this to be the first Epistle he wrote, and that immediately upon his conversion, and therefore thinketh it to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that fervency and heat which usually accompanieth new converts. But its rather to be attributed to the greatnes and dangerousnesse of the errour, and their pertinacy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for he makes the consequent of such opinions, to out the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:118921:114"/> maintainers of them from grace, yea and to make Christs death in vain.</p>
                  <p>This errour was the more intolerable in the <hi>Galatians,</hi> because they were not <hi>Jews,</hi> (to whom happily something might be indulged, because of their education in the Law, and the high esteem of it) but <hi>Gentiles</hi> newly converted to the faith from their Paganism, and so had not the temptation to dote on the Jewish way, to which they were wholly strangers.</p>
                  <p>Now, what is the righteousnesse of the Law? or to be Justified by the works of it? And what was the true and proper state of the Question between the Apostle and false teachers, will hereafter be more largely declared? In the mean time you may take notice, That among many other choice Arguments, this Text hath one against <hi>Justification by the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that in the words you have the <hi>Proposition</hi> to be proved, and the <hi>Medium</hi> by which he argueth.</p>
                  <p>The Proposition hath these parts in it:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Subject,</hi> with the note of universality in a negative way, <hi>No man.</hi> So that <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> and the holiest that are, are included in this Subject; in other places, <hi>its no flesh,</hi> Rom. 3. which is to shew the frailty and weaknesse of all, and that in every respect; for that phrase, <hi>All flesh is grasse,</hi> doth not onely reach to our bodily infirmities and mortality, but even to all the righteousnesse we have; and therefore <hi>John</hi> Baptist is to cry this Doctrine above all, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most preparatory to Christ and his righteousnesse: yea by <hi>David</hi> its said, <hi>None living is justified,</hi> which is so extensive, that some have thought it reached even to Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they are not justified absolutely by their own righteousnesse, but the context seemeth to restrain it to man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is the <hi>predicate</hi> or <hi>attribute [Justified]</hi> of which enough hath been spoken.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By what, or the cause of it, and that is <hi>by the Law. Law</hi> is taken sometimes <hi>largely</hi> for any Doctrine revealed by God, answering the Hebrew word <hi>Torah,</hi> in which sense
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:118921:115"/> our Saviour often quoteth it; or else more <hi>particularly</hi> for that preceptive part of the Scripture delivered by God unto the Jews, and is usually divided into the <hi>Moral, Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>Judicial Law.</hi> Now <hi>Law</hi> in the Text containeth all these kinds, and is not to be limited to the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> only, as some would have it.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, There is the person before whom this <hi>Justification</hi> is to be supposed, and that in <hi>Gods sight,</hi> implying, that though before men they may be justified, by walking very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameably, yet not before God.</p>
                  <p>The second part is the Argument to confirm the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that is drawn <hi>à repugnantibus,</hi> or <hi>contrariis;</hi> if we are justified by faith, then not by the Law; but we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by faith, as he proveth out of <hi>Habakkuk, The Just shall live by faith.</hi> The strength of this Argument is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in its time. The Observation is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Observ.</note>
                     <hi>None are justified by the Law;</hi> or, <hi>None can attain unto a righteousnesse by the works of the Law in Gods sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">None can be justified by the Law of God.</note>As we have already demonstrated, <hi>That none by nature have a righteousnesse to be justified by:</hi> So now we proceed higher, and shall evince, <hi>That none by the knowledge of, or obedience unto the Law of God, can be justified:</hi> For the Jew he easily thought the Heathen and uncircumcised person had nothing whereby to be accepted of by God; but for himself, he thought the Law, and the works thereof to be so glorious, that in and through them he expected reconciliation with God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tending to clear the point.</note>To discover this truth, which men of corrupt mindes have greatly clouded; consider these things,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, <hi>That the Scripture useth several synonimous words or expressions, when it denieth Justification by the Law.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Scripture cals it the <hi>Law of works,</hi> Rom. 3.27. op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positely to the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> which is called a Law largely, for no more then doctrine: Now its called the <hi>Law of works,</hi> because it promiseth life and favour upon no other terms then working or doing; and then of works, not of one or some works, but collectively, all works that are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Therefore the Apostle, immediately before in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:118921:115"/> pronounceth a <hi>curse unto every one that abideth not in all the things it requireth.</hi> And therefore the Apostle doth empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically call such as seek for a Justification in this way <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, They have nothing else to stand upon, they build on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on this foundation, they look wholly to what they do; sometimes its expressed absolutely and simply, as here in the Text <hi>[By the Law]</hi> sometimes by <hi>the Law of Moses,</hi> Acts 13.39. sometimes by <hi>the righteousnes of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3.21. sometimes the <hi>Law of righteousnes,</hi> Rom. 9.31. The Jew is there reproved for <hi>following the way of righteousnes,</hi> sometimes a <hi>mans own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,</hi> Rom. 10.3. And the Apostle addeth, <hi>My own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which is of the Law,</hi> Phil. 3.9 Sometimes its said <hi>works</hi> simply, not works of the Law, but works in the general, therby exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. It is therefore good to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the several expressions Gods word useth, when it denieth Justification by the Law, and the rather because eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of these expressions may obviate some subtil distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or other that Justitiaries have brought in.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the second place, that is a vain and empty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which the Papists alledging <hi>Augustine</hi> for it, do maintain. They distinguish between <hi>Justitia legis,</hi> and <hi>ex lege,</hi> or <hi>per legem;</hi> The righteousnesse of the Law, and a righteousnesse from or by the Law; Righteousnesse of the Law is that which the Law requireth and commandeth; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse by the Law, is that which a man doth by the sole direction and command of the Law without any assistance and help of grace by Christ. By this distinction <hi>Bellarmine, Pererius,</hi> and others think to salve all the Objections that are brought against their Justification by inherent righteousnesse. For whereas we urge those many Texts that do expresly deny Justification by the works of the Law, and wholly make it impossible for righteousnesse to come by it, then they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately runne to this refuge of <hi>Justitia legis,</hi> and <hi>ex lege.</hi> But this is a roof without any foundation; for every one may observe that the Apostle useth these expressions indifferently, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, even as on the contrary <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, so that as it would be an absurd thing to make a distinction of <hi>Justitia fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei,</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:118921:116"/> and <hi>ex fide,</hi> or <hi>per fidem,</hi> a righteousnesse <hi>of</hi> faith, and <hi>from,</hi> or <hi>by</hi> faith, no lesse ridiculous is it to coin such a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence about the Law. Indeed we grant, That the Law hath a righteousnesse it requireth, and that all believers are subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to it as a rule; yea its impossible but that they should be under the directive and preceptive power of it: God himself cannot dispense with, or disoblige a creature from loving him with all his heart and soul; yet this righteousnesse in the perfection of it cannot be attained unto in this life, and therefore is not to be looked upon within the circle of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And certainly to evade such pregnant places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture with such a brittle and aerial distinction as this, as to think cobwebs-harnesse good enough to save against a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-bullet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In what sense Iustification is denied to the works of the Law.</note>But because great thoughts of heart, and that of the most learned, are in this point, <hi>Let us particularly consider, how and in what sense Justification is denied to the works of the Law.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>There is a grosse and corrupt interpretation of Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing spirits, That the Law did only require a carnal, external righteousnesse, and to this was promised onely a temporal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal reward.</hi> To this sense <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the Text, who therefore makes the Law not able to give life, because that was only conversant in an external righteousnesse, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene promises; and thus many have looked upon all the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Old Testament, as so many <hi>Swine</hi> feeding on husks, and not at all acquainted with, or delighting in the pearl of Christ. So that by these Doctors, the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Christ, works</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> shall be thus opposed; that in the Old Testament, all things were visible and carnal, both duties and promises, no faith in Christ, no expectation of heaven; but now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, <hi>All things are become new,</hi> the duties more spiritual, and the glory expected eternal. But the Apostle instanceth in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> for the patern of our <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi> and makes their Salvation to be by <hi>Christ,</hi> as well as those that have lived since his coming, hence all their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices did lead to Christ, and their general expectation was of a <hi>Messias,</hi> though generally they had earthly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:118921:116"/> thoughts about him, <hi>And Christ was even the end of the Law to him that beleeved.</hi> This interpretation therefore may without much difficulty be exploded.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>There are those, who say, the works of the Law, to which Justification is denied, is only of the Ceremonial Law.</hi> And this hath had many Abettors, as if the Apostle all along in this dispute had argued onely against those that pleaded for a necessity to retain all the Ceremonial Worship, That unlesse they were circumcised, and observed dayes, and were constant in their Sacrifices, they could not be justified; and truly its no doubt but this is part of that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour which the Apostle doth so vehemently dispute against, and for which cause he cals them <hi>beggarly elements,</hi> Gal. 4.9. <hi>Elements</hi> (saith <hi>Cameron</hi>) because the false Teachers in their account judged them the necessary principles and foundation of Religion, as if no spirituall building could be reared, unlesse these were first laid, but yet <hi>beggarly,</hi> because they had no worth or dignity in them in respect of <hi>Justification.</hi> And it must also be granted, that as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by <hi>Acts</hi> 15. the controversie began at first about this point meerly, <hi>viz.</hi> the necessity of retaining <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi> with other legall Rites; and because the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of them was pleaded to Justification, Therefore in the <hi>Protract of the dispute, it brought in also all works, as well as these, even such as the Moral Law commanded.</hi> So that the Apostle pleadeth a Justification in Christ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or a righteousnesse of faith against all works of the Law, yea all works absolutely considered, and that it is not to be limited to the Ceremonial Law, or works thereof, appeareth</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because the Law, whose righteousnesse is excluded, is <hi>that which pronounceth a curse to all that continueth not therein,</hi> Gal. 3.10. Now this doth more properly belong unto the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, as the Apostle <hi>James</hi> urgeth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>He that break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one is guilty of all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, The righteousnesse of the Law, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly opposed to the righteousnesse of faith, is that which consists in <hi>Do this,</hi> Rom. 10.5. <hi>Do this and live.</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:118921:117"/> Now this also doth immediately belong to the Moral Law.</p>
                  <p>Further, That Law is denied in Justification, and the works of it, by which we come to know sinne, and are convinced of it; but that is chiefly and properly the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law. This Argument the Apostle expressely useth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>None is Justified by the works of the Law,</hi> and this is made the reason, <hi>Because by the Law is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of sinne.</hi> Yea <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. by the Law sinne is said <hi>to abound,</hi> and to cause more corruptions in a man. That therefore which accidentally procureth more sinne, and so more guilt, and matter of condemnation, that cannot be a Justification to us: Now this also is the work of the Moral Law.</p>
                  <p>Again, That Law and its works is disputed against, which yet is not to be made void, is to be established; for the Apostle in all his Objections against the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse by it, doth yet still preserve the dignity of the Law that he doth not make it void. Now its plain, that its true onely of the Moral Law, for the works of the Ceremonial Law, to be Circumcised, to offer Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not now to be done by us, because Christ the body is come; The blossoms fall, when the bud and fruit it self cometh; And therefore, though the same God, who said, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> said also, <hi>Thou shalt circumcise, Thou shalt Sacrifice,</hi> yet the commands of the former sort which are Moral, stand; but these of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which are Ceremonial, they are abolished. Thus you see not onely a pretended righteousnesse, by observing the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, but also by obedience to the Moral Law is shut out from Justification.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Others therefore they are convinced, That the works of the Moral Law are excluded from Justification; but then such onely as are done by the power of nature, and strength of free-will;</hi> As if the zeal of the Apostle were carried out only against such as should hold, that for the goodnesse of those works they did without the power and help of grace, they were justified: And thus the Papists generally, <hi>The works</hi> (say they) <hi>excluded and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:118921:117"/> against are such as men without the grace of Christ, being acted by their own strength solely do perform.</hi> In this Assertion they greatly triumph, thinking it no lesse then blasphemy, to deny Justification to those works that are done by the grace of God; but also, this is more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to be spoken to in that distinct Head, That we are not justified by works of grace under any notion or respect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; yet something must be said at present to pull this beam out of their eye.</p>
                  <p>And first,<note place="margin">That none can be justified by works of grace.</note>
                     <hi>Those works the Gentiles and Heathens did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their knowledge and faith in Christ, could not properly be said to be the works of the Law, or to have a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Law.</hi> Now the Apostle proveth, That the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> they were not justified by the works of the Law, who yet were formerly sinners of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> as the Apostle expresseth it. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Argument, though it may reach the Jew, yet it would not the Gentile; for how could the Gentile think, that the works of the Law which he knew not, or heard not of, could justifie him? Therefore <hi>Romans</hi> 2.12. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle distinguisheth of two sorts of men, the <hi>Jew</hi> and the <hi>Gentile;</hi> The <hi>Jew</hi> he cals one in the Law, the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> one without the Law. If then the Gentile be one without the Law, and so without the righteousnesse of it, it cannot be imagined, that the Apostle should so industrious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove, That they were not justified by the Law, or the works of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We grant indeed, <hi>That none can be justified by the works he doth without the grace of Christ;</hi> but the Question is, Whether the Apostle meaneth no more? Whether these are all the works that he excludeth from Justification? And we blame this Interpretation, though having some truth in it, at least in reference to the Jew, as greatly defective in respect of the Apostles main scope. By the works of the Law cannot onely be meant works done by the power of nature, without the grace of Christ, because the Apostle excludeth the works of such as were believers; Therefore its all kinde of works, as
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:118921:118"/> works. This appeareth in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is said to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by beleeving, oppositely to working; Its not spoken of <hi>Abraham</hi> before his Call, and while living in Idolatry, but a long time after his knowledge of God. If then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> works be shut out, when and while a beleever, yea a friend of God, How much more must the works of those, who are in an inferiour rank? But of this more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>We shall instance in these <hi>Galatians,</hi> who are reproved for countenancing and abetting of this errour; They were not Infidels or Pagans, they had received the Gospel, they had received the Spirit, and had suffered many things for the Gospel; yet the Apostle tels them, That they must not seek to be justified by the works they yet do; The Apostle argueth an impossibility of righteousnesse by the Law, not meerly respectively to what they were once, but at any time, even since their conversion, as well as before their conversion. This is fully evinced by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument brought in the Text, <hi>No man can be justified by the works of the Law;</hi> Why? Because <hi>The Just shall live by faith:</hi> So then, even the just man, he who is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, liveth not by works, but by faith. This Argument had no consequence at all in it, if so be the controversie were understood of men working onely by natural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for what is the just mans living by faith to a natural man acting in his meer naturals? Whereas if we say, The Apostle excludeth all works, either of unregenerate or regenerate, then this is a very powerfull Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the just man as long as he is in this world, must live by faith, and that in the matter of Justification, as well as in other things.</p>
                  <p>A man in the progresse of Justification is justified still by faith, as well as at first: Hence this Text is again urged for continuance in Justification, as well as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance thereunto, <hi>Romans</hi> 1.17. where in the Gospel the righteousnesse of God is said to be revealed from faith to faith.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Apostle doth not exclude the works of the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:118921:118"/> Law onely done by nature, because this would necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre such an opinion to be held by the Galatians, that would be wholly irrational, if not impossible;</hi> for these <hi>Galatians</hi> did receive the Gospel, and beleeve in Christ, they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Justification and Salvation by these; Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle re-mindes them of that great joy they once took in this Doctrine of the Gospel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. Where is the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse you once spake of? They called it a blessed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and they were blessed tidings of peace, but their zeal and fervency did abate, since they added their works to Christ. None are ever able with a raised pitch of soul to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Christ, that give the least <hi>iota</hi> or <hi>tittle</hi> unto works more then the Scripture requireth; Seeing therefore the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> did not raze the foundation, or wholly reject Christ, who can think that their opinion was, they could be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by works done without him? For why did they believe in Christ still? Why did they retain and hold the Gospel for all this corrupt addition, but because they looked for Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Christ in part at least? Could they think they were ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified without Christ, and then come to Christ to be justified? So that its to conceive an irrational, if not an impossible er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, That they who did believe in Christ for Justification at least in part, yet should at the same time think they were or might be justified by works done without Christ. And it may be said, The Apostles Arguments to the contrary were very weak, if they did not hold this, for thus he argueth, <hi>If Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification be by the works of the Law, then Christ died in vain, then you are fallen from grace, then Christ profiteth nothing;</hi> for how would this follow, if works of grace were excluded? for works of grace did suppose Christs death, do necessarily include grace and advantage by Christ; whereas works done solely by natural strength, did necessarily exclude Christ and grace. This (I confesse) hath some specious colour; but yet the Answer is, That such consequents of the Apostle are very strong, for even those that joyn works of grace and Christ, works of the Law, and the faith of the Gospel, do <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> shut Christ out of all; and although they may with their mouths and pens professe Christ and his
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:118921:119"/> grace, yet really they deny both. The <hi>Galatians</hi> indeed did not think or intend to fall from Christ, yet in the nature of the thing, without repentance or recovery, they did fall from him, and deny him; for not to give Christ all that is due to him, to put him off with half is to make him no Christ at all. So that by this we see, its a very high sinne, (wherein the zeal of an holy Apostle, otherwise very meek and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate) burneth as hot as fire, to put confidence in the works we do, though they be supposed works of grace we do. The Apostle said, <hi>If he should give his body to be burnt, and have not charity, it would profit him nothing;</hi> but if thou shouldst give thy body to be burnt, and have charity, and that in a great measure, yet if thou put any trust in this, thou deniest Christ, and makest him to die in vain. Indeed there are men who cannot be guilty of this sinne, for none ever thought to be justified by the works of sinne, and the devil: But there are others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain attending to the works of righteousnesse, and they may quickly swallow down this poyson: Therefore let them take heed of establishing to themselves a false righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, a <hi>Dagon</hi> that can never stand before God.</p>

                  <p>WE have hitherto shewed what Exposition is made of <hi>the works of the Law,</hi> and whether in whole or in part such interpretations are to be rejected: and what other senses are given in this matter, may be reduced to one of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> heads. As that of <hi>Castellio, De Justif. p.</hi> 27. when he saith, He dare boldly make this distinction between the righteousnesse of the Law, and that of faith; The righteousnesse of the Law is an external obedience coming from a servile fear; The righteousnesse of faith a virtue of the minde contrary to vice, which God gives freely to those that beleeve, pardoning their by-past sins.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore consider in the next place,<note place="margin">Reasons why the works of the Law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not justifie.</note>
                     <hi>Why Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be by the Law, or righteousnesse attained by the works of it.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Because the righteousnesse of the Law requireth an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> perfection in the subject who is thereby justified.</hi> Rom. 10. The righteousnesse thereof is in <hi>Do this and live. Do this</hi>] yea this, and this, and all in every <hi>iota</hi> or <hi>tittle,</hi> or else there
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:118921:120"/> is no life. Therefore such a Justification as this was onely possible to <hi>Adam</hi> while he continued in his integrity. Christ (say some) was justified in this manner by the works he did, and then the Angels they were justified by their faithfull continuance in obedience to God. Now then, if there be not one man to be found since <hi>Adams</hi> fall, that can plead righteousnesse by a <hi>[Do this]</hi> then he must seek for Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion some other way. This is so evident, that howsoever Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists generally go another way, yet <hi>Cajetan Comment. in</hi> 3. <hi>ad Rom.</hi> maketh this difference between the righteousnesse of God, and the righteousnesse of the Law. The righteousness of God (saith he to this effect) is that whereby a man is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely accounted of as just, both in respect of what is past, as also what is present and to come. The righteousnesse of the Law is that whereby a man for the present and to come, is accepted of as just, but for the sinnes past that cannot give a righteousnesse. There is some truth in this; for suppose that there were such an infusion of righteousnesse into us, that thereby we are inabled to keep the Law of God perfectly, yet how shall we do for a righteousness for our by-past waies, before this infusion was? <hi>Cajetan</hi> therefore in this respect saith right, That the righteousnesse of God, which is the same with the righteousnesse of faith and the Gospel, is that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>reby we are looked upon as just before God, in respect of our former conversation. But this can never be by the Law, for that requireth a perfection from the first to the last. To have once sinned, and but once, though a man could be immediatly restored unto integrity again, is to make the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes of the Law impossible to us; So that righteousnes by the Law, though once possible, yet to us accidently by our corruption is impossible; and therefore in this life, while we have the reliques of corruption, we are to cry out: Oh mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, naked and poor creatures, as we are! Who will help us to a righteousnesse to cover our nakednesse?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Justification cannot be by the Law, because the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture makes Justification by faith and the Law two immediate contraries.</hi> If we are justified by faith, we cannot be by the Law; The East and the West may be as soon brought together,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:118921:120"/> as these two kindes of Justifications. This Argument is pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Apostle in my Text, and the verse following, <hi>The Law is not of faith;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10, The righteousnesse of the Law, and the righteousnesse of faith are made two immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate opposites. The Scripture then alwayes speaking of these two, as diametrically opposite, it must necessarily follow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law and faith, as Christ said of God and Mammon, <hi>You cannot serve God and Mammon;</hi> so neither can you have the righteousnesse of the Law and faith together; you may as well serve two contrary Masters, as enjoy these two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary righteousnesses. Therefore the endeavours of such who would make a righteousnesse compounded of the Law and faith, is as vain as those who would build <hi>Jericho</hi> again; and indeed the very nature of them is as immediately contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as light and darknesse, and as inconsistent as the Arctique and Antarctique Pole, for the righteousnesse of faith suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth me altogether miserable, wretched in sinne, and naked in my self; The righteousnesse of the Law supposeth perfection and all fulnesse in me; Now how can a man be both these at the same time?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Righteousnesse cannot come by the Law, because that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> curseth every man by nature, and so is a minister of wrath and condemnation.</hi> This Argument the Apostle urged in the verse before my Text, <hi>As many as are of the works of the Law, are under a curse:</hi> Why? <hi>Because it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> We may then as well expect water from the fire, and sweetnesse out of gall, as righteousnesse by the Law; he that runneth to this as a refuge, when Gods anger pursueth him, doth as the man the Prophet speaks of that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on the wall, and the Serpent bit him. Alas, when Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Justice shall arraign thee, wilt thou plead the Law? That wil heap up thy wrath more, that will add more stings to thy guilt. Its observable that <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. when this was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>Cursed is he that continueth not in all the words of the Law to do them,</hi> the people were to say, <hi>Amen:</hi> what was this but to ratifie the curse against themselves, onely hereby they were taught to go out of themselves, and to renounce all that
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:118921:121"/> righteousnesse they gloried in, and to seek to him in whom all <hi>the promises are Amen,</hi> because in the Law all the curses are <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Righteousnesse cannot come by the Law, because we are justified by an imputed righteousnesse, whereas the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a personal inherent righteousnesse.</hi> This seemeth to be very cogent, for whereas with Popish Writers, the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Law and of the Gospel differ onely <hi>secundum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi> and <hi>minus,</hi> as an Acorn and an Oak, a childe and a man, the one imperfect, the other more perfect; its evident by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that these two righteousnesses differ <hi>specie,</hi> and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any addition ever be made the same; yea the more perfect and compleat our righteousnesse personal and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent would be, the lesse imputed it would be, and so be the farther off from a Gospel-righteousnesse Now that our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is an imputed righteousness, appeareth by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent affirmation of it by <hi>Paul,</hi> and that in one Chapter, <hi>Rom</hi> 4. and hence also the same Apostle would <hi>be found in Christ, not having his own righteousnesse which is of the Law, Phil.</hi> 3. Yea 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. we are sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to be <hi>made the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God in him.</hi> If then Christ be our righteousness, if his obedience be reckoned as ours, then this is as far distant from a legal righteousness as heaven from earth: But of this more in its due time, because this imputed righteousness is the great thing controverted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, <hi>If the righteousnesse of the Law justifieth, then Christ died in vain, then grace is abolished, then Christ is become of no effect unto a believer.</hi> These are consequences the Apostle himself makes; and although a <hi>Galatian</hi> might have replied, The consequence is denied, for we beleeve in Christ, we hold him also necessary to Justification, and faith in him, as well as the works of the Law, yet would not this have satisfied <hi>Paul,</hi> because if Christ be not wholly received for Justification, he is not received at all: Christ was not made part of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse unto us, but righteousness in the whole. And indeed it must needs be a great debasing of Christ, to make his death and sufferings a co-partner only with our works, that Christ with us should make up a compleat Saviour. This is so gross
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:118921:121"/> an absurdity, that learned Protestants, affirming the Pope to be Antichrist, when assaulted with this Objection, That they believe Christ to be come in the flesh; They believe Christ to be God and man; Its answered, Because they deny Christ in his Offices, especially in this matter of Justification by him, joyning works with him, that therefore they may be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to deny him. Furthermore upon this account, Christ would have died in vain, if righteousness could come by the Law, for to what purpose did Christ bring a righteousness, if the Law had brought it before? Yea, if this were so, then the contrary to what the Apostle affirmeth, it would prove true, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Law did invalidate and disanull the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. Look not then upon this errour as meer hay or stubble: No, it cometh too near razing the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it self: For although some learned men in this point have laboured, if not to reconcile Protestants and Papists, yet to make it doubtfull, Whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hold a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental errour? <hi>(Hooker Eccles. Polit. in Treat. of Just.)</hi> yet if we consider the Apostles zeal, and his Arguments which he useth against the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who yet did believe in Christ; The Wenne seemeth so big that the breasts of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cannot cover it, yea that its a Cancer rather which eateth up the life of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>If righteousnesse could come by the Law, then it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> would by one of these three wayes, either because we are able per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to fulfill the Law by a personal righteousnesse, or because the Law condescends from its perfect exactnesse, and requireth no more then we can do; or though we cannot perfectly obey the Law, yet God will account of, and accept this imperfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as if it were perfect.</hi> But neither of these three wayes can righteousnesse be communicated unto us; not from the first, for he onely fulfilleth the Law that is alwayes without sinne, that never committed the least iniquity. Now the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>John</hi> saith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.10. <hi>If we say we have no sinne, we make God a liar, and there is no truth in us.</hi> The Papist there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore makes God and his Apostle <hi>John</hi> a liar in this particular. The Law requireth a total perfection, a gradual perfection, and this continually, a perfection <hi>subjective, objective</hi> and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:118921:122"/>
                     <hi>adjunctivè,</hi> that <hi>Do this and live,</hi> is a thunderbolt to strike down every man; None is able to stand before it, <hi>For in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things we offend all,</hi> and what we do comes not up to the perfection of the rule, and whatsoever is <hi>minus quam esse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, ex vitio est,</hi> as <hi>Augustine.</hi> They must therefore have low thoughts of the Laws perfection, who have such high thoughts of their own graces.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It cannot be that the Law abateth of its exactnesse, and commensurateth it self to our power, for thus many say, The Law is not such an hard task-master as many make it: Its not such a strict immovable Rule, but like <hi>Paul, It becomes all things to all men;</hi> it descends to the power and capacity of man, and is no further obligable then mans power doth extend it self: But <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. doth acknowledge the spirituality and holinesse of the Law; The obliging power of that, even then when he found nothing <hi>but evil present with him;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> doth often commend the perfection of the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it requireth what is every way necessary, not being deficient in any thing: Now seeing its our duty to have what <hi>Adam</hi> lost, and he losing such an admirable perfection, God requireth this of us still; The debt is due, though we are bankrupts and cannot pay it. Do not then bring down the Law to thy power, but acknowledge thy duty by the Rule; The Rule continueth a Rule, though thou art not able to attain unto it. Indeed sometimes the godly are said <hi>to keep the Commandments, and to walk unblameably therein,</hi> but that is in respect of sincerity, and because of their study and endeavour after perfection. Its true, the whole heart is sometimes opposed to hypocrisie, and a double heart; but when its joyned with those Concomitants, <hi>to love God with all the heart, all the soul, and all thy strength;</hi> This requireth more then any man can do in this life: especially that the Law obligeth beyond our power, is plain, because we still have sinne in us, lusts and sinnefull motions, as the Apostle complaineth <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Now if these were not forbidden by the Law, they could not be sins, for <hi>where there is no Law there is no transgression.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, <hi>What is imperfect God doth not own as
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:118921:122"/> perfect.</hi> This is an evasion which some later Writers much applaud themselves in, they acknowledge, That we are not able to fulfill the Law, they confesse we break it in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things; but then they adde, <hi>God doth graciously through Christ forgive our imperfections, and accepteth of this, as if it were the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> Now indeed we grant, That the obedience of the godly, though very drossie, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many imperfections, yet through Christ is accepted of, and God looks upon them as true and upright men, not hypocrites and prophane; but yet for all this, they are not accepted to Justification; We cannot say, That by these we are justified, for that were to make God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce otherwise then the truth is; How can they be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Just by that which is not exactly Justice? Gods Judgement is alwayes according to truth, and he doth not judge of things otherwise then they are. Now if God should account of these as satisfying the Law, and answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perfection of it when they do not, it would suppose errour or mistakes in God,</p>
                  <p>Thus you have heard, That righteousnesse cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the works of the Law, yet to what hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, its necessary to adde some <hi>Cautions;</hi> for even <hi>Paul</hi> when he preached this Doctrine was traduced by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and they inferred many false consequences, gathering thorns of the vine, and thistles of the fig-tree.</p>
                  <p>First therefore, <hi>Though Justification be not by the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Law, yet this is not to condemn it, to make it an uselesse thing, as if there was no wisdome or goodnesse of God seen in the manifestation of it.</hi> No such matter, We see the Apostle with great indignation rejects such inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yea <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. he giveth this commendation of the Law, <hi>That its holy and spiritual,</hi> laying the whole blame upon himself, <hi>He was carnal and sold under sinne;</hi> distinguish then between that which floweth from the Law <hi>per se,</hi> and of its own nature, and that which cometh from it by accident, and through our own corruption. Thus it is, The Law was at first given to <hi>Adam</hi> to justifie him by the works there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; It would have given life to him; This was the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:118921:123"/> and intended end of it; but upon mans rebellion, whole mankinde is plunged into all sin, and so no more able to obey this Law, then blinde men see, or dead men walk. The Law therefore finding us such, is so farre from communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a righteousnesse to us, that it aggravateth our sinne, making it out of measure sinfull, and filling us with wrath and guilt; it is we and not the Law that are to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Excellent food is not to be condemned, but the corrupted stomack that cannot digest, yea which increaseth its disease by it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This is not so to be understood, as if the Law were wholly abrogated, and of no use to us.</hi> It continueth as a Rule, though not as a Covenant by which we are to be justified. Thus the Apostle denieth <hi>that he makes void the Law,</hi> Rom. 3.13. <hi>yea we establish the Law;</hi> Therefore the Apostle, even when he so vehemently argueth against Justification by the Law, doth yet presse the duty of the Law. Its one thing to love God, to delight in him, to walk in his Commandments, and another thing to expect Justification by them: This is to mingle heaven and earth, when we confound Justification and Sanctification: So that the works of the Law may be considered two wayes, either in respect of the Command or Direction of the Law to which we are enabled by the Spirit of God sanctifying us; and in this sense we preach the Law, we command the works of the Law, and desire God would write his Law in your inward parts.</p>
                  <p>But then the works of the Law may be secondly considered as the Conditions of our Justification, and whosoever look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on them thus, he rejects Christ and his grace. This is a dangerous errour, when we do the works of the Law for this end, when we love God, endeavour to keep his Commandments, that thereby God may pronounce us righteous.</p>
                  <p>Hence in the third place, <hi>We must distinguish between the works of that righteousnesse which the Law requireth, and the righteousnesse of works.</hi> All the people of God make it their businesse to abound in the works of righteousnesse. The Scripture commands and encourageth thereunto, but then
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:118921:123"/> it doth as much condemn a righteousnesse of works. We have a remarkable expression, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.25. <hi>It shall be our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, if we observe to do all that God commandeth us;</hi> our righteousnesse, not our righteousnesse to justifie us, but a <hi>qualitative righteousnesse</hi> to denominate us so inherently, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>He that doth righteousnesse is righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.7. Let not then this Doctrine discourage from that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of life the Law requireth; Say not, What have we to do with the Law and Sanctification? For although it be not appointed to justifie, yet it is commanded as the way we should walk in; yea the Law is not onely a directive Rule, but accidentally a School-master to bring to Christ; For when by that we are convinced of sinne, and have nothing but despair in our selves, this driveth us out to Christ, and though it cannot be our <hi>Do this and live,</hi> yet Christs <hi>Do this</hi> procureth eternal life; Though we are not justified by our works, yet we are by Christs, and whatsoever the Scripture denieth to us it attributeth to him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>It cannot be denied but that it is a very hard thing to presse the Law as a Rule of righteousnesse, and not to have it looked upon as a Covenant by which we are made righteous</hi> Why should we be bound to follow holinesse, and yet not for this to be justified before God? Hence this confidence in the works we do hath been a sinne of old in the Church; The Prophets did most zealously rebuke it, and we see in the beginning of the Christian Church, what entertainment it had both doctrinally and practically. Now what was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done in reference to the commands of the Law, is still generally with us respectively to Gospel-duties: Are there not hundreds to one Christian that fiducially rest upon their Christian performances, that look not to Christs-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in their duties? Now to such we may say, You who seek to be justified by the duties of the Gospel, you fall from grace, and Christ is become of no effect unto you. This sin is like a moth secretly consuming many thousand without any noise. If the Apostle charge some not <hi>to trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God;</hi> How much more not to put confidence in thy works but in Christ, for this spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:118921:124"/> in works for Justification, is greater Idolatry then trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in wealth, because hereby we rest on them for that which is more directly and immediately Gods work, for God only forgiveth sin, and justifieth a man at his Tribunal; and truly, why should there be such voluminous disputations for that righteousnesse to justifie, when the greatest patrons thereof at the close finde a misgiving of their hearts? as <hi>Bellarmines</hi> known <hi>Tutissimum est,</hi> and <hi>Suarez (Disput. de orat.)</hi> adviseth him that prayeth, not to think of, or mention his merits in prayer, <hi>ob periculum superbiae</hi> for fear of pride; what is this but to provide a potion for the diseased, and then to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the taking it for fear of killing him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse of Instruction.</hi> How blessed a thing it is to be directed in this point of Justification, to be assured what is that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse God will own; Satan hath alwayes by his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments endeavoured to take away, the live childe, and put a dead one in the room. Let that be thought a matter of great moment, in which the Apostle sheweth so much zeal. As the <hi>Psalmist</hi> said, <hi>Some put their trust in chariots, and some in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but we will in the name of God;</hi> So let us, some put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Law, some in their duties, some in good works, some in faith, some in both, but we will trust in Christ, who is <hi>the Lord our righteousnesse;</hi> Every thing in the Temple was to be covered with gold, and thus we are <hi>to put on the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> that nothing of our nakednesse may appear, <hi>but Christ may be all in all;</hi> live not, die not, but in this covering.</p>

                  <p>AT the close of the precedent Chapter, the Apostle see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to depresse the Office of Christs Ministry in the Church too much, making Apostles and Officers to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to the Church, and wholly in reference to it. Lest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this should puff up private beleevers, and make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue or contemn their Officers, he giveth necessary coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. in this matter: for when the Authority of Church-Officers is despised, then confusion and licentiousness breaks forth. <hi>[Let a man]</hi> that is, every man (an Hebraism) of what rank or dignity soever, though of never such abilities and graces, <hi>Account,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is to account upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and judicious comparing of things together. There ought to be a serious and well-grounded esteem of them.</p>
                  <p>Then there is the cause or ground of this account, and that is described in such properties that denote the Ministers dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and yet his duty; his duty in that they are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> the word doth not signifie every kinde of service, but that which is most toilsom and laborious, a Metaphor taken
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:118921:125"/> from those that row in a boat, so great a care is required in them to bring the ship of Christ safe to the haven; They are also <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Stewards,</hi> not <hi>Lords</hi> or <hi>Masters,</hi> nor called to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and vanity in the world. Thus all the names given to Christs Officers they are names of labour more then honour, yet in the second place, There is their dignity also, <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, and Stewards of the mysteries of God;</hi> What can be more sublime and glorious then this, to be workers with God for mens salvation!</p>
                  <p>Having thus declared what men ought to esteem of the Ministers of God, he thereupon sheweth how little he is moved with the thoughts men had of him. Mans judgment is called in the Greek, <hi>his day,</hi> as among the Latins <hi>diem dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re:</hi> Though <hi>Hierom</hi> thought this a phrase peculiar to the <hi>Cilicians,</hi> yet the learned shew that it is an Hebraism. Now the Apostle doth the rather slight mens judgements, because he had a good conscience in the discharge of his Office.</p>
                  <p>So that in the words you have <hi>Pauls</hi> Justification of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as to men, and his disclaim of any Justification thereby, as to God. His Justification before men, is in these words, <hi>I know nothing by my self;</hi> which is not universally to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as if he knew no sinne at all in himself; for <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. he makes sad complaints of corruptions working in him, but he speaks it <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> in respect of his Ministry he had not been an unfaithfull <hi>Steward of Divine Mysteries,</hi> he was not guilty of any crimes that his adversaries could charge him with; and although he expresseth it negatively (he knew nothing by himself) yet that supposeth a positive and sincere course of his life, both in respect of his Ministry and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. But lest this should seem arrogancy and spiritual pride, be renounceth all Justification by the works he did, <hi>yet am I not hereby justified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grotius</hi> limits the sense too much, as if Justification doth denote only freedom from sinne; and in another place speaks superciliously <hi>(Proleg. in Epist. ad Rom.)</hi> as if none before him had hit right upon the Explication of the word in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But in its time, I shall make good, That Justification is more then a bare remission of sin.</p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:118921:125"/>
                  <p>In the last place we have a reason given why <hi>Paul</hi> is not justified by what he did, because the Lord judgeth him, he who knoweth more sinfulnesse and corruption by man then the most Eagle-eyed Christian can discern, God is greater then our hearts, and so is acquainted with those errours and failings that the most tender-hearted Christian cannot take notice of.</p>
                  <p>This place doth not prove an uncertainty of Justification, as the Papists would inferre; for they grant, That <hi>Paul</hi> knew assuredly by revelation that he was a justified person, onely it strongly evinceth, That <hi>Paul,</hi> and so no man regenerate is justified by any good works he doth in this life; and so where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as many would evade the power of several places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, That only works of the Law, or such as are done by our own strength, are excluded: This place is stronger then <hi>Samsons</hi> new cords, it holds the adversaries so fast, that they know not how to wrest themselves loose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That even the most holy and regenerate man is not justified by the works of grace which he doth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Observ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth is the more diligently to be asserted, by how much the errour that confronts it is more specious and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and maintained by such abettors, whose repute is not so easily cast off, as the former we spake of. And that we may keep to the proper point in hand, take notice,</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That the Question is not, Whether we are justified by works, though flowing from grace as meritorious or efficient of Justification?</hi> This the Opinionists we have to deal with, do reject with indignation. To make works either merits or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient causes of our Justification before God, they grant, is directly to oppose the Scriptures, yea they seem to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Orthodox, as giving too much to faith, because its made an instrument of our Justification, therefore they are to be acquitted at least from grosse Popery.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Although to maintain faith and obedience to be the conditions, and a</hi> causa sine quâ non <hi>of our Justification, be the professed and avowed doctrine of the Socinians,</hi> yet some of late have asserted the same doctrine, <hi>that yet abhorre Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism;</hi> for the <hi>Socinians</hi> deny Christs Satisfaction, and his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:118921:126"/> Righteousnesse in fulfilling of the Law for us, and so make good works a condition of our Justification, not through and for Christ a Mediator, but from the meer grace of God (as they expresse it) who hath no such justice as to need a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by an atonement through Christs bloud. Though therefore these later sort of Writers assert the same thing with <hi>Socinians,</hi> yet upon different grounds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Neither is the Question about <hi>the necessity of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and sanctification in those that are justified; Justified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons will abound in the fruits of holinesse, that sweet fountain within will also bring forth sweet streams; This good tree will bear good fruit;</hi> onely the Question is, <hi>Ʋpon what account these are required in justified persons? Whether in some causality or concurrence as faith is, onely not with such a degree of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency? Whether good works be required as well as faith, so that we may say, Justifying Repentance, Justifying Law, as well as Justifying Faith?</hi> This is positively and vehemently affirmed by some, but certainly those Arguments and Reasons they bring are too weak to gain-say the torrent of Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. Its good to sail between <hi>Antinomianism</hi> on the one hand, and this errour on the other hand; and while we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate one errour, not to runne into another extream. This therefore I shall (God willing) undertake to prove, That good works are not Conditions, or <hi>à causa sine quâ non</hi> of our Justification; and although the Abettors of this opinion do give faith the preheminence, and make it the principal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, yet if they will rigidly stand to the Apostle <hi>James</hi> his words, (which they say, they are much awed with) faith must be lesse principal, and works be that which giveth life to faith, that it may be inabled to justifie; and thus indeed it is affirmed, That works make faith alive, as to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its end of Justification. But of this more when we shall shew the inconsistency of Authours with their own selves, in answering their great Objection taken from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>James.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I proceed therefore to shew, <hi>That no godly man is justified by his works, or works though done graciously, yet are not the condition of a mans Justification, as faith is.</hi> And</p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:118921:126"/>
                  <p>First, I shall instance in the great patern and example of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our Justification, <hi>Abraham,</hi> from whom the Apostle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth a Justification of all believers in the like manner he was. Now that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not justified by works, or his working, though a godly man, the Apostle, makes it his whole businesse to prove, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. This place is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Orthodox to be very pregnant for Justification without works, even those of a regenerate or godly man; for <hi>Abraham,</hi> though a godly man, and <hi>the Father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> yet even then when he was godly, was not justified by any works he did, but by faith. This place is the more to be insisted upon, because its the proper seat of Justification. The Apostles scope is expresly to determine how a man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, and no learned Lawyer was ever more carefull to put in many words in the Deeds that he makes, to exclude all cavils and shifts for the future, then was this divine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle diligent to shut out all erroneous glosses, insomuch that we may despair of satisfying that man, who is not convinced from this example: For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> who useth not to be very ingenuous, doth acknowledge that this is <hi>gravis difficultas,</hi> for <hi>Abrahams</hi> works are excluded while he was godly, and in the state of grace. Though this mountain be so strong, yet there are those who set their shoulders to heave it away. What the Papists answer, I shall not much matter; but what others more refined do bring in, is worthy consideration. <hi>The works</hi> (say they) <hi>that are excluded, are works of the Law; the Law requiring a perfect personal righteousnesse, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fulfilled by any, only Christ satisfied this; and then that we might be partakers of this righteousnesse, faith and good works are required as the conditions, so that the works of the Law are excluded, not of the Gospel.</hi> But this cannot be a solid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because the Apostle speaketh generally of works in this description of Justification, though in other places he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times saith, the works of the Law, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> could not be instanced in for such works, and therefore the Apostle speaks universally of works, <hi>quâ</hi> works: Certainly, as they say, its not fit for us to teach the Spirit of God what to say. So
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:118921:127"/> this is good counsel in this particular. When we reade that the holy Ghost speaks generally of all works, Who are we that we should limit it to some? The Apostle then nameth works, when he treateth on purpose, how we are justified and excludeth them; and this is the more cogent, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the opposition between faith and works. The Apostle directly opposeth the believer and the work, which could never be if Gospel-works were not excluded; nay by this means there could be no contradistinction at all, because faith it self, if considered in Justification as a condition only its respected as a work; How then could the Apostle make such an immediate contrariety between these two? By their interpretation, the believer should be opposed only to some kinde of works and faith, not to all, but to some kinde of works, which if so, the Apostles Argument had then no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary consequence.</p>
                  <p>Again, That works of all sort are excluded, is plain, if you consider the object of Justification, who it is that is here said to be justified, and that is the ungodly. By the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is one meant that hath not a sufficient and adequate holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so that <hi>Abraham,</hi> though regenerated, yet as to Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is ungodly, he cannot stand before God or endure, if all his imperfections are enquired after. Now certainly, he that fulfilleth the conditions of Justification cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ungodly, for he doth all that which is required: So that this is very considerable, that all those whom God justifieth, he justifieth them not for any thing they have of their own, or any conditions they have performed, but as such who are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in a strict examination, and so deserve condemnation, and therefore no works of grace are looked upon.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, That all works are excluded, is evident by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles allegation out of <hi>David,</hi> who makes mans blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be in this, That God imputeth righteousnesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works: Who can perswade himself that <hi>David</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only works of the Law, when in his time, that Question which so perplexed the Christian Church in its infancy, was not started? So that the Apostle making this righteousnesse to be imputed, and that without works, doth counsel a man
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:118921:127"/> to exclude all works whatsoever in this great point of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and indeed it is at last confessed, That its faith onely which makes the contract between God and the soul, That good works are not required to this initial consenting unto Christ, so as to make him ours, but in the progresse. This is that in effect, which the Papists affirm in other words, That the first Justification is onely by faith, but the second by good works.</p>
                  <p>Against this general exclusion of all works is opposed, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. where the Apostle saith, <hi>To him that worketh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is of debt;</hi> from whence they gather, That works onely which are debts, are excluded: But if this be seriously thought on, it makes strongly against them; for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Argument is <hi>à genere,</hi> if it be by works, its of debt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are not works of debt, and works of no debt. This supposition would make the Apostle to argue insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and weakly: If our works be of grace and imperfect, then to them the reward is reckoned of debt, though not so much as if they were fully perfect. Neither will it avail to say, That these Gospel-graces cannot be debt, because Gods Spirit inableth us thereunto: For if a man (as <hi>Paraeus</hi> well urgeth) set two labourers on work, and to one he lends him tools to work, the other brings his own tools, at the close of the day both receive their wages for their labour, not of debt, though one had his tools given him.</p>
                  <p>The second Argument may be from the peculiar and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> difference that the Scripture giveth between faith and other graces, in respect of Justification: So that faith and good works are not to be considered as concurrent in the same manner, though one primarily, the other secondarily; so that if faith when its said to justifie, doth it not as a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in some other peculiar notion, which works are not capable of, then we are not justified by works as well as faith. Now its not lightly to be passed over, That the Scripture still useth a peculiar expression of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is incommunicable to other graces. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. Remission of sinnes is <hi>through faith in his bloud,</hi> Rom. 4.5. <hi>Faith is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Righteousnesse,</hi> Rom. 5.1. Gal. 2.16. and in many
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:118921:128"/> other places, still the expression is, <hi>Justified by faith; Christ dwels in the heart by faith,</hi> Ephes. 3. Believing is <hi>receiving of Christ,</hi> Joh. 1. Act. 10.43. <hi>Remission of sinnes is received by faith,</hi> Act. 26.18. Gal. 3.14. <hi>The promise of the Spirit is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by faith:</hi> Insomuch that as Christ is the Serpent exalted, so faith is the eying of the Serpent, whereby we are healed: That as the meer looking upon the Serpent cured without any other medicinal helps and endeavours: Thus the meet believing on Christ doth justifie without other works co-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating therein.</p>
                  <p>From these expressions it is that our Orthodox Divines do say, That faith justifieth as its an instrument, laying hold on Christ, so that Christ received by faith is properly that which justifieth, not faith it self, or any dignity in it. This is the hand that receiveth the jewel, which doth enrich us. This Doctrine, though so generally received and avowed by all Protestant Writers, yet of late is rejected among other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <hi>Because there cannot be any passive instrument.</hi> Now I much wonder that <hi>Bellarmine, Becanus,</hi> and other subtil Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites that turned every stone to overthrow faiths instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in Justification, should so farre forget their Logick and Metaphysicks, as not to pitch upon this Objection above all, that there cannot be any such thing as a passive instrument. Truly I think, when a man of godly affections broacheth an errour, which he taketh to be a truth, he himself is a passive instrument to bring others into errours. If we regard natural causes and moral, we may easily mention many passive instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: In <hi>natural things</hi> the <hi>throat</hi> is a passive instrument of drinking. The <hi>Conduit-pipe</hi> of conveying water, and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty such instances men may think of. In <hi>morality,</hi> taking that largely, there are many passive instruments, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and all wicked men are Gods passive instruments. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent by which the Devil deceived <hi>Eve,</hi> was a passive instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and to come nearer to our purpose, Who can deny but that <hi>miraculous faith</hi> was a passive instrument in doing miracles, for the power of working miracles is infinite, and could not be communicated to a creature no more then the Creation of a world, onely they by resting on Gods power,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:118921:128"/> God wrought these wonderful things by them. But nothing doth so fully represent this, as the opinion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and others following him, that <hi>intelligere</hi> is <hi>pati,</hi> and so <hi>videre, audire,</hi> are <hi>pati,</hi> to understand is to receive, and so to see and hear; the soul doth these by those faculties which are pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive instruments therein; and therefore when <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would prove, That <hi>credere</hi> and <hi>apprehendere</hi> were actions and works; Its well answered, That to believe or to lay hold on Christ (The Greek word applied often to faith is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) Though they be Grammatical actions, yet they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally passions, as <hi>intelligere, videre,</hi> are active verbs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Grammar, but naturally and physically are passions: So that a man in believing is passive, that is, he receiveth Christ for his righteousnesse: But of a passive instrument more hereafter. Justification is not in giving something to God, but in receiving from him; we do not curiously litigate about the word instrument; by <hi>instrumentum</hi> we mean no more then <hi>medium,</hi> whereby the soul receiveth the Gospel-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse tendred unto it, and those peculiar expressions you heard the Scripture giveth to faith, can evince no lesse. If therefore faith justifie upon a peculiar reason, That that grace onely hath, <hi>viz.</hi> because it receiveth and applieth Christ our righteousnesse, then other graces and holy works, having no such capacity cannot justifie. As the hand onely, not the eyes or the feet, are the instrument that take almes given to a poor man. This consideration made that learned man M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                     <hi>Ball,</hi> say, How faith and works should be conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as concauses in Justification, is impossible to conceive. <hi>Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Cov. of Grace, p.</hi> 70. And its a meer Sophism to say, That if by faith we receive Christ, and faith is the receiving of Christ, then we receive Christ by receiving; for its not the notion of faith that is properly the instrument receiving, but faith as the habit putting it self into act. So that the meaning is, faith acting or laying hold upon Christ, is the instrument receiving him. Neither is this to give too much to faith, no more then in the faith of miracles, when Christ said to some, <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole,</hi> that thereby our Saviour gave any dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to faith, as if that were the cause of their health.</p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:118921:129"/>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third <hi>Argument</hi> is, <hi>If in the continuance and progresse of our Justification, we are justified after the same manner we were at first, then its not by faith and works, but by faith only as distinct to works.</hi> The strength of this Argument lieth in this, In granted, The first consent and willingnesse to receive Christ, is that which justifieth, and good works are required by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation thereunto, as opportunity serveth: So that (by the way) it must be confessed, That faith in some doth justifie them antecedently to good works, and that some may be so prevented, that their faith could not co-operate with their works; and how will this agree with that discourse they form out of the Apostle <hi>James, Chap.</hi> 2? But that which I pursue by this Argument is, That in the same manner we were at first justified, we are alwayes justified: But its granted, We are not at first justified by works: Therefore not afterwards. Now this truth; That we are justified at first, as afterwards, will appear by these two Texts of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. where <hi>the righteousnesse of God</hi> is said <hi>to be revealed from faith to faith.</hi> Not to mention the several descants of many upon this place. That which the most solid Interpreters pitch upon is, That in our Justification we begin with faith, and go on in faith; its from faith and to faith, as parallel expressions from <hi>strength to strength, from glory to glory.</hi> Therefore the Apostles sense is, That in our Justification we proceed not from faith to works, as these must hold, that make works the secondary condition of our Justification, but <hi>from faith to faith;</hi> by faith we began, and by faith we continue. The second Text is, from the place formerly insisted on, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. where the Apostle proveth, <hi>A just man is not justified by the works of the Law, because he liveth by faith;</hi> If then in the progresse of our Justification we live by faith on Christ, then are we not justified by works, for why might it not be said as well according to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion, That we are justified by works, because the just shall live by his works? But I think this would be very harsh to any tender ear. Neither will that <hi>crambe</hi> not <hi>bis,</hi> but <hi>decies costa</hi> avail, That works of the Law onely are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for works of the Law may be so called, either <hi>quoad efficientiam,</hi> as if the Law could enable us to what is good,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:118921:129"/> or <hi>quoad normam,</hi> in respect of the regulative part of it, and thus all the works that regenerate men do, are works of the Law, if they do <hi>not murder,</hi> if they <hi>keep the Sabbath,</hi> if they <hi>take God for one God,</hi> and so put confidence in him. This is a work of the Law; and in this sense <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>He delighted in the Law of God in the inward man.</hi> And thus that Evangelical Righteousnesse they speak of, is legal in this sense, that is, its according to the rule of the Law: Consider therefore this seriously, take heed of beginning in faith, and ending in works; Do thou go on from <hi>faith to faith,</hi> not from believing to doing.</p>

                  <p>VVE proceed to a fourth Argument by which it is to be proved, <hi>That we are not justified by works as a condition, or a</hi> Causa sine quâ non, and thus it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that is justified by fulfilling a Condition, though he be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> thereunto inabled by Grace, yet he is just and righteous in himself. But all justified persons as to Justification are not righteous in themselves, but in Christ their Surety and Mediator.</hi> I say, They are righteous as to Justification in their own persons,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:118921:130"/> who fulfill the Conditions of Justification. But the justified person in the Gospel-way, though he have a <hi>qualitative righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,</hi> whereby he is truly and <hi>inherently just,</hi> yet as to a righteousnesse of Justification, that is not his own, but anothers; Even the righteousnesse of the Lord Christ recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and made his by faith; Two particulars are comprized in this Argument, and both of them seem so evident, that they need not much proving.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That he which fulfils a Condition on which Justification depends, is righteous in himself; for seeing no more is required but this Condition, and that is supposed to be performed by the man that worketh; Therefore he must needs be righteous in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; for though this righteousnesse be originally from Grace, yet it is subjectively a mans righteousnesse:</hi> So that we may call it <hi>a mans own righteousnesse,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> doth <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. and <hi>the works of righteousnesse which we do,</hi> Tit. 3.5. So that as the temporal mercies which are given of God to us, we call our own, our own health, our own wealth: Thus the holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which we act, though inabled to them by Gods Spirit, and so efficiently are the fruits thereof, yet subjectively and formally, they are our own, our own faith, and our own repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: So that if we fulfill these Conditions, we are righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to Justification by that which is our own and inherent in us: yea, I think, if it be well weighed, it will be found to be a contradiction, to say they are Conditions, and yet a <hi>Causa sine qua non,</hi> of our Justification: for a <hi>Causa sine quâ non</hi> is no cause at all; but a Condition in a Covenant strictly taken, hath a moral efficiency, and is a <hi>Causa cum quâ,</hi> not a <hi>Causa sine quâ non.</hi> If <hi>Adam</hi> had stood in his integrity, though that confirmation would have been of grace, yet his works would have been a causal Condition of the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse promised. In the Covenant of Grace, though what man doth is by the gift of God, yet look upon the same gift as our duty, and as a Condition, which in our own persons is performed; This inferreth some moral efficiency, and so though in words they deny, yet indeed they do exalt works to some kinde of Causality: And for a <hi>Causa sine quâ non,</hi> though good works may be granted to be such in reference
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:118921:130"/> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> yet they cannot be so in respect of <hi>Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as in the next Argument will appear: For though it be granted, That Justification and an holy purpose to do good works are inseparably joyned together, yet every thing that is inseparably concomitant to another thing is not a <hi>Causa sine quâ non.</hi> A man cannot be but in a place, in an <hi>ubi;</hi> yet to be in a place, or as they call it <hi>ubication,</hi> is not a <hi>Causa sine quâ non,</hi> of a man. What hath been spoken may evince, That he which performeth a Condition to which any priviledge is annexed, though inabled by grace, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth and fulfilleth that in himself, though not of himself.</p>
                  <p>The second particular is, <hi>That though a believer is just in himself with an inherent rightousnesse, yet as to Justification, he is righteous in another.</hi> I shall onely mention the Texts here, because they are to be improved, when we speak of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteousnesse:</hi> That we are righteous in Christ is clear by that full place, notwithstanding all the violent wrestings of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Christ was made sinne for us who knew no sinne, that we might be made the righteousnesse of God in him.</hi> We are made <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> and the <hi>Righteousnesse of God,</hi> but <hi>in him:</hi> And <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Be found in him, not having my own righteousnesse.</hi> But <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. its made very clear, where all along the Chapter, the Apostle cals it an <hi>imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,,</hi> not that it is <hi>putative,</hi> or that it is not truly <hi>ours,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly its not <hi>ours inherently,</hi> but accounted of by God, as if it were our own personal righteousnesse: We are not then ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, because we fulfill Gospel-conditions in our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but because we are in Christ, who is made of God <hi>our righteousnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fifth <hi>Argument</hi> is that which so much sounds in all books, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                     <hi>If good works be the effect and fruit of our Justification, then they cannot be Conditions, or</hi> Causa sine quâ non <hi>of our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> The Consequence is clear, because such a supposed Condition, or <hi>Causa sine quâ non,</hi> must be antecedent, and going before. Now the Orthodox bring <hi>Augustines</hi> known Position, which also may be made good out of Scripture, <hi>Bona opera non praecedunt Justificandum, sed sequuntur Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum;</hi> And another to that sense is quoted out of <hi>Gregory;

Its a thousand times affirmed by our Divines, Many things are required to the constitution of some Subject, which yet are not either causes or conditions of such and such an effect: Light is necessarily required, and drinesse, as qualities in fire, ye it burneth as its hot, not as light or dry. To the integral being of a man, are required his head and shoulders, so that the eye could not see, if not seated there, yet a mans shoulders are not the <hi>Causa sine quâ non</hi> of his seeing. Many things are necessarily conjoyned together, and yet one is not the Condition of the others
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:118921:132"/> effect. So that this Doctrine doth not exclude, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand holy works, onely it giveth faith and works their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place.</p>
                  <p>The sixth <hi>Argument, If Justification be by works as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> then one man is more or lesse justified then another, and those works are required to one mans Justification which are not to another, so that there shall not be two godly men in the world justified alike.</hi> For if faith justified as a work, then he who had a stronger faith would be more justified then he that hath a weaker: But even the weakest Christian, who by faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth Christ, is justified as fully as the strongest Christian, because the righteousnesse of our Justification doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the activity of our faith, but in the fulnesse of Christ received by it; so that as Christ is not a fuller Christ to one then to another, so neither is Justification more in one then in another. The <hi>Protestant Writers</hi> speak no blasphemy, when they say, <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was as much justified before God, as the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> for as the same Sunne communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates its light to one as well as another, and is not exhausted, if there were more men in the world to make use of its light: So Christ is the same compleat treasure of all righteousnesse to his people, and is not exhausted by communicating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to all: Insomuch that the weak Christian may comfort himself, saying, Though I have not so much grace, such ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of holinesse as another, yet I have as full a Saviour as a stronger hath.</p>
                  <p>Its true, one man may have more sense and perswasion of his Justification then another, and as was formerly shewed, Justification may be extensively in one more then another, but it cannot be essentially or intensively, which it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be if works be the Condition; for he that perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Condition, more or lesse, receiveth the priviledge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised more or lesse.</p>
                  <p>The seventh <hi>Argument, This Assertion according to the sense <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> of the late Writers,</hi> (that are otherwise Orthodox, for I mean not of <hi>Socinians) will bring in a Justification two wayes, or make a two-fold Justification, whereof one will be needlesse</hi> For they grant, <hi>An imputation of Christs righteousnesse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:118921:133"/> of the Law, he fulfilled that, and satisfied Gods Justice, that the Law cannot accuse us.</hi> And besides this, <hi>They make an Evangelical personal Justification, by our own Evangelical works.</hi> Now certainly this later is wholly superfluous, for if Christs righteousnesse be abundantly able to satisfie for all that righteousnesse which the Law requireth of us, What is the matter that it removeth not all our Evangelical failings, and supply that righteousnesse also? Surely this is to make the starres shine when the Sunne is in its full lustre. Thus it may be observed, while men for some seeming difficulty avoid the good known way of truth, they do commonly bring in Assertions of farre more difficulty to be received. In this case its farre more easie to maintain one single righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, <hi>viz.</hi> the obedience of our Lord Christ, then to make two, whereof one shall be imputed and legal, the other Personal and Evangelical. Thus the <hi>Socinians,</hi> while they pretend the Doctrine of the Trinity impossible to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and as that which doth transcend all humane faith: Do they not assert a thing as improbable to reason, That Christ should be a constituted God, and God command all such adoration, faith and obedience to be given to him, as belongs to God himself? We hold he is naturally a God; they say, he is a made God. Certainly this later is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. Thus men that do not believe where they ought, commonly beleeve other things more incredible, and more then they ought.</p>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. <hi>That cannot be a Condition of Justification, which it self needeth Justification; But good works being imperfect, and having much drosse cleaving, need a Justification to take that guilt away.</hi> Its true, Justification is properly of persons, and of actions indirectly and obliquely, yet when the person is justified, then his actions are accepted of. Now then those things cannot be a Condition of acceptance, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves need acceptance: How can we conceive God forgiving sinne, and accounting us as righteous for those actions, which in themselves deserve eternal damnation? Its true, the holy actions of a righteous man, may be truly and properly called righteous and good, but because they are not exactly ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:118921:133"/> to the rule of righteousnesse; Therefore it is that in Gods severe judgement, they are damnable. This Question therefore is again and again to be propounded, if good works be the condition of our Justification, How comes the guilt in them that deserveth condemnation to be done away? Is there a further condition required to this condition, and so another to that, with a <hi>processus in infinitum?</hi> The Popish party and the <hi>Castellians</hi> are so farre convinced of this, that therefore they say, <hi>Our good works are perfect.</hi> And <hi>Castel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> makes that prayer for pardon of sinne, not to belong to all the godly, but to be upon a supposition, if and when we do sinne, then we are to pray for pardon, as the command is <hi>To agree with our adversary, viz.</hi> if we have one; and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy Father, viz.</hi> if we have a Father; so if we do sinne, then we must pray for the pardon of it; and for an holy life, he saith, <hi>Christ doth as perfectly sanctifie us, as he did heal the lame and blinde</hi> (De Justif. pag. 48) <hi>Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>if a man cured of his lamenesse, should yet by his unwary walking stumble at some root in the way, should he for this be called a lame man?</hi> And therefore in another place, <hi>pag</hi> 46. he saith, <hi>Facessat haec opinio, quae imperfectionem vitium esse statuit,</hi> he complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the Orthodox, as holding whatsoever is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is a sinne. But we acknowledge a two-fold imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>negative</hi> or <hi>comparative.</hi> Thus an Angel, and man cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in integrity is comparatively to God imperfect; This is not a sinne, because we are not bound to have the perfection of God. But then there is a privative imperfection, when there is not that degree of grace in us which ought to be, and this is a sinne, and for the pardon of such sinnes, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to pray, and because of this pollution adhering to our best actions it is, that <hi>Paul</hi> judgeth them <hi>dung and drosse</hi> in reference to Justification, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.

                     </gap>, <hi>Yea doubtlesse I do count all things;</hi> If therefore the Apostle had not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the present graces and priviledges he enjoyed, his speech
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:118921:134"/> had not risen higher, which yet he evidently intended; and in this sense the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> of old complained, <hi>Our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesses are as filthy rags,</hi> Isa. 64.6. <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaks this in the person of the whole Church, and not relating onely to the wicked and ungodly; therefore he useth the word <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>our righteousnesses,</hi> respecting that native corruption that clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to every thing we do; not only their unrighteousnesses, but their very <hi>righteousnesses were filthy rags.</hi> Its true, <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> forsakes this place in his Comments, as not proving the imperfections of our holy duties; but generally the learned do urge this place, and it doth strongly seem to hold out that truth. And <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 9.18. speaks fully to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>We present not our supplications before thee for our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesses, but for thy great mercies.</hi> This likewise was visibly represented, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38. where <hi>Aaron</hi> the <hi>High-Priest,</hi> a type of Christ, <hi>was to bear the iniquity of their holy things.</hi> Neither is that Argument, so greatly applauded by some, of any strength at all, <hi>viz.</hi> That if there be imperfection clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to every gracious act, then at the same time the soul doth will and nill; That it produceth one act, and a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act thereunto at the same time: for this imperfection is herein discovered, because the principles of grace do not act so vigorously and intensly as they ought to do. Therefore being more remisse then God requireth, this defect is a sinne; so that there is not required a contrary <hi>nolition</hi> to what we will in that instant, but its an imperfect <hi>volition.</hi> Although we may adde, that the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. and <hi>Gal</hi> 5.17. speaketh of a <hi>combate,</hi> and a <hi>contrary lusting between the flesh and the Spirit,</hi> which whether it be instantaneous or succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive (though such successive acts are imperceptible) is not here to be disputed.</p>
                  <p>Others would avoid this Objection, by saying, <hi>That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-graces, which are the Conditions of the Covenant, are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to the Law, and so Christ in satisfying the Law doth remove the imperfections cleaving to them:</hi> And they judge it absurd to say, <hi>That Christ hath satisfied for the sinnes of the second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or breaches thereof, which is said to be only final un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:118921:134"/>
                  <p>But this answer may be called <hi>Legion,</hi> for many errors and contradictions are in it. As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How can justifying faith <hi>quà talis</hi> in the act of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repentance, be reducible duties to the Law taken strictly? Indeed as it was in a large sense discovered unto the Jews, being the Covenant of Grace, as I have elsewhere proved, <hi>(Vindic. Legis)</hi> so it required justifying faith and repentance. But take it in the sense, as the <hi>Abettor</hi> of this opinion must do, justifying faith and repentance must be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the works of the Law. And then</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If so, then the works of the Law are conditions of our Justification; and thus he runneth into the extream he would avoid.</p>
                  <p>But above all, that is not to be endured, That Christ hath not suffered for the breaches of the new Covenant, and that there is no such breach, but final impenitency; for are the defects of our repentance, faith and love in Christ, other then the partial breaches of the Covenant of Grace, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse, our unfruitfulnesse, yea sometimes with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> our grievous revolts and apostasies? What are these but the sad shakings of our Covenant-interest, though they do not dissolve it? But it is not my purpose to fall on this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of its impertinency to my matter in hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. <hi>If works be a Condition of our Justification, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> must the godly soul be filled with perpetual doubts and troubles, whether it be a person justified or no.</hi> This doth not follow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally through mans perversnesse from the fore-named Doctrine, but the very genius of it tends hereunto; for if a Condition be not performed, then the mercy covenanted cannot be claimed: As in faith, If a man doth not beleeve, he cannot say, Christ with his benefits are his; Thus if he have not works, the Condition is not performed, but still he continueth without this benefit. But for works, How shall I know, when I have the full number of them? whether is the condition of the <hi>species</hi> or <hi>individuums</hi> of works? Is not one kinde of work omitted when its my duty enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate my Justification? Will it not be as dangerous to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that one, as all, seeing that one is required as a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:118921:135"/> If it be said, That by good works is meant onely a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and resolvednesse to do them when occasion is offered; this is to forsake the state of the Question, and the Apostle <hi>James</hi> who doth industriously prove, That they are works exercised and practised that do justifie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> The last <hi>Argument</hi> is, <hi>That if good works be a Condition of Justification, then none are justified till their death, because to every good work is required perseverance, insomuch that perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance is that to which the promise is made,</hi> Mat. 24.6. <hi>He that endureth to the end shall be saved,</hi> Heb. 10.38. <hi>If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. Thus often</hi> Revel. 2.7, 26. <hi>To him that overcometh and keepeth my works to the end, &amp;c.</hi> So that it is not good works simply, but persevered in, that are required, and therefore no Justification till the end of our dayes, so that we cannot have any peace with God till then. Neither doth it avail to say, Justification is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat till then, for it cannot be at all till then, because the condition which gives life to all is not till then. Whether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance and good works are distinct, are nothing to this purpose. Its certain, <hi>Adams</hi> and the Angels graces were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from perseverance; but howsoever, if perseverance be works persevering, I cannot be justified till this condition be so performed.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have asserted this truth by many Arguments, and though any one singly by it self may not convince, yet all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether may satisfie. Its now time to answer that great Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which seemeth so directly to oppose not only what we have said, but also what the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> so plainly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly affirmeth; For whereas <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>That Abraham was justified by faith without works;</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>By faith, and not by works</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, The Apostle <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 2.23, 24. saith, <hi>Abraham was justified by works,</hi> and in the general, <hi>That a man is justified by works, and not by faith onely.</hi> So that in outward appearances these two great Apostles speak contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which hath made some deny the Canonical Authority of <hi>James</hi> his Epistle: Yea one said blasphemously <hi>Althamei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Mentiris (Jacobe) in caput tuum.</hi> But this is to cut, not unty the knot. The Spirit of God which breathed in all the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:118921:135"/> holy Pen-men cannot dictate any contradictions.</p>
                  <p>Therefore that a reconciliation may be admitted,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>James</hi> reconciled.</note> its neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that the Apostle <hi>James</hi> take the word Justification, and the word faith in another sense then the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> and that their scopes in these expressions were upon different grounds. And hitherto the reformed Churches have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agreed in this particular accord of these places,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the scope of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> is to treat upon our Justification before God, and what is the instrument and means of obtaining it; and this he doth against those Jewish teachers, <hi>That we were justified by the works of the Law.</hi> But the Apostle <hi>James</hi> takes Justification for the declaration and manifestation of it before men, and useth the word <hi>faith</hi> for a <hi>vain title</hi> and <hi>empty profession</hi> of it, herein disputing against <hi>carnal Gospellers,</hi> who from the misunderstanding of <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine did cry down good works, and an holy life as needlesse, saying, This <hi>titular faith</hi> was enough; for <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of some in his dayes, that because he magnified grace so much, would therefore inferre, <hi>Let us sinne that grace may abound; Paul</hi> informeth us, <hi>That faith onely justifieth,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> what <hi>kinde of faith</hi> it is, even a <hi>lively working faith;</hi> and certainly that this is <hi>James</hi> his intent, appeareth <hi>vers.</hi> 14. <hi>What doth it profit, though a man say he hath faith and no works?</hi> Is not this to confute such a man that gloried in the name and Profession of Christ, not at all aiming at a godly life? <hi>Abraham</hi> did not say, he believed, and had no works in this sense. The Apostles instance likewise concerning Charity, doth evidence this, <hi>If a man say to one in necessity, Be warmed, and be cloathed, but do nothing to relieve him, is this acceptable charity?</hi> I forbear more Arguments, because our late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are copious in it.</p>
                  <p>Its said, They dare not go against the plain words of the Apostle.</p>
                  <p>But first, Its not to <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>IN the former part of this Chapter the Apostle had strenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously asserted the manner of our Justification from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which having at large pursued, lest any should think that was <hi>Abrahams</hi> personal priviledge, and did not at all belong to us, there seeming a great diversity between <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith and ours, at the 23<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
                     <hi>verse</hi> he applieth this example to us also, shewing that <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all believers, all that walk in his steps are justified alike. And here we see a full overthrow of that <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine, That we and the godly in the Old Testament are not justified in the same
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:118921:136"/> way; If this were so, the Apostles argument from <hi>Abraham</hi> to us would be nothing to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>In the words we have a two-fold use of Gods imputation of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith to righteousnesse. The former is for his own consolation and hope. The other is for us, who, though we have not so great a faith and strong as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, yet having the same object, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ the promised seed, we may rejoyce as well as he did. Take we therefore these words as they relate to us, we may consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Benefit</hi> or Priviledge spoken of, <hi>To whom it shall be imputed,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, The true and proper use of the word is to be handled hereafter, because the full understanding of that is of great concernment; onely for the present observe, the Apostle useth a future verb, to signifie the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of this mercy in the Church, That as God did, so still he will justifie those that shall believe, in the way he justified <hi>Abraham;</hi> The <hi>Benefit</hi> is, that their faith shall be imputed for righteousnesse: In what sense this is to be understood we shall hear anon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is the <hi>Subject</hi> to whom this great priviledge shall be made good, and that is to those that do believe: without this hand that heavenly treasure cannot be received. Its not those that work, but that believe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here is the <hi>Description</hi> of this justifying faith from the <hi>true and specifical Object of it;</hi> for though justifying faith doth believe the whole word of God, the Histories and the Threatnings, yet it doth not justifie, but as it relates to God in Christ. This justifying faith therefore is described from the fiducial nature of it, <hi>He that believeth,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as its not used among Heathenish Authors; so in the Scripture it denoteth the recubency and fiducial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that the soul hath in the object believed, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it be applied to such as did not firmly believe, <hi>John</hi> 2.2. its described from the object, which is God raising up Christ, <hi>Who was delivered for our offences, and rose for our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</hi> This expression, saith <hi>Paraeus,</hi> is <hi>brevis</hi> and <hi>lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi> short, because in few words; but long, because its the summe of the Gospel. We see then what is the object of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:118921:137"/> faith in its Justification, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ crucified, and raised by the Father for the expiation of our sins, and Justification of our persons; faith doth not justifie as it is a work, or from any intrinsecal dignity in it, but from the object, which is the Lord Christ, it layeth hold upon.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then we have formerly shewed, That our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not by works that we do under any notion whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we now proceed to confute those, who make <hi>faith as it is a work,</hi> or the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                     <hi>credere</hi> to be imputed unto us for our righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Observ.</note>
                     <hi>That faith, not as it is a work, or for any dignity in it self, but from the object Christ Jesus, doth only justifie us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is necessary to be handled with much diligence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some, though they exclude works, yet make faith to justifie as it is a work, and to be in stead of all that legal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, which God required in the Covenant of works, That faith should be in the Covenant of Grace, what works would have been in the Covenant of works.</p>
                  <p>Before we come to the argumentative part, take notice of some particulars:</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, <hi>That when faith is all along this Chapter, said to be imputed for righteousnesse, thereby is meant</hi> Justitia personae <hi>not</hi> facti, <hi>an universal righteousnesse of the person, not of the fact.</hi> Some are very pertinacious in the exposition of it this later way, and parallel it with that place, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.31. where <hi>Phineas executed Justice, and it was accounted to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,</hi> where all agree, that was a righteousnesse of the fact; for being it might be doubted, whether he had any call to it or no, God did approve it, and looked on it as a just and righteous act. The like expressions we have <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.25. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.13. in which places an universal righteousnesse of the person, so as to be justified before God is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. Now that in this Chapter we must necessarily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the phrase thus, appeareth in that the Apostles scope all along the Chapter is, to shew what is that whereby we are justified before God, how we do become blessed, and have our iniquities forgiven us, and if it were not so, we could not be justified as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, for <hi>Abrahams</hi> believing, as
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:118921:137"/> it was a work cannot be put in practice by us, though our faith may be exercised upon the like objects his was. Neither can it be doubted, whether <hi>Abraham</hi> did well or no in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that therefore it should be accounted a righteous act, and free from any accusation of it. The righteousnesse then <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of is so universal, that thereby the person is justified in all points before God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That this phrase (Faith imputed to righteousness)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> may have several interpretations, for which there are many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do strive.</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Pontificians,</hi> they consider <hi>faith materially,</hi> as it is a bare and naked assent, not formed as yet by charity, and so (they say) faith doth justifie <hi>dispositivè;</hi> They make such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked assent to be a disposition to our Justification. Now although this Historical or Dogmatical assent be necessarily required to Justification, yet this is no disposition to it, seeing even devils and hypocrites have it. Again, They consider faith as it is enformed by charity, and so they make it part of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteousnesse, and that by it we are formally justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea causally and meritoriously, as we are by any other good work. But this proceedeth upon a false supposition, that Justification doth formally consist in that righteousnesse which is subjectively seated in us, as also from the perverting of the Apostles constant argumentation, from the position of faith to the exclusion of works.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are others who expound it thus, We are justified by faith, that is, faith as it is a work, is accepted of by God for our Justification, and these are divided into two sorts, first of <hi>Socinus, Servetus</hi> and others, who make the act of faith to constitute us just before God, (<hi>Lubber. contra Bertium, p.</hi> 27.) Not that this is done for the merits of Christ, or any satisfaction made to the Father; but these two things they affirm, first, That faith as a work justifieth. Secondly, That it is the meer grace and condescension of God to reckon this faith for our perfect righteousnesse. This they call <hi>Dei gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiosam acceptilationem,</hi> accounting that which is lame and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect for perfect obedience, for they make faith to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by obedience, obedience to be <hi>forma fidei,</hi> of which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:118921:138"/>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But there are a second sort, and these do pertinaciously assert the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                     <hi>credere</hi> to be our righteousnesse, and that the phrase, <hi>Abraham believed, and it was imputed to him for righteousnesse,</hi> is to be understood properly without any Trope at all. The ring-leader of this was <hi>Arminius</hi> (for I regard not <hi>Abailardus</hi>) who expresly saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>credere impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari in justitiam, id; proprio sensu non Metonymicè, (Epist. ad Hippol.)</hi> and in other places, Faith is the object of divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; faith as it is an act performed according to the command of the Gospel, is imputed before God for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and that of meer grace, seeing it is not the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of the Law, and thus <hi>Bertius, Vorstius,</hi> with many others, as may be seen in <hi>Festus Honnius (Speci. Cont. p.</hi> 82.) denying it to be considered as an instrument, but as a condition or duty in Justification. And to this purpose a late English Writer hath manifested himself, <hi>As God in the first Covenant of works required an absolute and perfect obedience to the whole Law for every mans Justification; So</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the Covenant of Grace he requireth nothing of man, but onely faith in his Sonne, which faith shall be as available unto him for his full Justification, as a perfect righteousnesse should have been under the first Covenant.</hi> Thus you see what is the sense of these Authours, That faith as it is a duty requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Covenant of Grace, is accepted of by God for all that whole righteousnesse which we were bound to have; onely it may be wondered, why they should thus attribute it unto faith, seeing <hi>Vorstius, Bertius;</hi> and others, say, Works are not excluded from Justification, <hi>viz.</hi> such works as flow from the sincere root of faith, and that the Apostle excludeth onely works of the Law done by our own strength, and such as wherein a constant and perpetual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Law doth consist; and therefore they say, that rule of <hi>Augustines, Good works do not precede but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the person justified,</hi> is <hi>humanitùs tradita,</hi> and never to be admitted, as being not a Scripture-truth, unlesse by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification be meant conversion from sinnes to righteousnesse. Therefore to reconcile this, they must certainly with the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> confound faith and repentance.</p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:118921:138"/>
                  <p>Lastly, There is a party that expounds this phrase <hi>[Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> beleeved, and it was imputed to him for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse]</hi> not in a proper sense, but a figurative, either a Metonymy, or a Metalepsis; By faith is understood that thing, which faith apprehended and laid hold upon. Thus its often said, Faith justifieth <hi>organicè,</hi> and <hi>relativè,</hi> in respect of the object it receiveth, That as the hand recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the treasure which makes a man rich; so doth faith receive that Christ, who is made of God our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: So that faith doth not justifie from any dignity or worth it hath, no not for the work of apprehension or application of Christ, but meerly because of Christ. This is that Interpretation which we conceive to be the most orthodox, grounded upon Scripture, and consented unto generally by the Reformed Churches. Onely I adde, should it be granted, that faith is understood properly, yet it will not thereby necessarily advantage the Authors we oppose, as is more to be shewed. Its true, with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius, Episcopius,</hi> and others, its matter of offence to say, Faith justifieth as an instrument, but onely as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition prescribed by the Evangelical Covenant; and I heartily wish others had not swallowed this Camel.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>When we speak of faith justifying or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to righteousnesse,</hi> you may take notice of these two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That faith hath <hi>its adequate and general object.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Its principal and specifical.</hi> The adequate and general object of faith is the whole word of God, consisting of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, Threatning, Commands, as well as Promises. True faith doth give firm assent to all Gods word, because Divine Authority and Revelation is the form of it. But then the principal and secondary object is the Promises, as the <hi>Objectum quo,</hi> but Christ in them as the <hi>Objectum quod;</hi> and faith justifieth not as it believeth the whole word of God, but as it rests on Christ. In the Text it is, <hi>On him that raised Christ from the dead, who was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for our sinnes:</hi> But because this is controverted, more may be said of it hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:118921:139"/>2. As faith hath a two-fold object, so it hath a two-fold effect. There are the effects of faith <hi>ad intra,</hi> and the effects of it <hi>ad extra.</hi> The effects of faith within, are as it respects Christ, and layeth hold on him, in which sense it is often said, <hi>to receive,</hi> as you formerly heard, and in this respect onely it justifieth; and secondly, There are the effects of it <hi>ad extra,</hi> as faith puts us upon the exercise of all holy duties, in which sense the Apostle speaks of it in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. It was their faith made them have an holy fear, and inabled them to self-denying passages of obedience, but we are not thus to look upon it as working, when we speak of our Justification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Therefore in the fourth place, <hi>Take heed of confounding faith with obedience, as too many do, our Justification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in receiving from God, not giving to him; and faith stretcheth out the hand to take, not to give.</hi> There is a great deal of difference in these two expressions, or the sense of them, when you say of a poor lame beggar, his hands help, his hands relieve him, and when you speak of a labouring man, who works all the day long for his wages, for the hands of the later relieve him as they work, of the former as they receive: Thus our faith makes us partakers of this excellent priviledge, because it receiveth Christ into the heart; whereas if we look upon faith, as obedience, we are taken off from Christ, and look to our selves; and although it may be granted, That faith is in some sense obedience, yet in the act of Justification its not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as obediential. But to speak the truth, the places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced in for to prove the obedience of faith, are not to the purpose, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26. for faith is not there taken for a grace in the soul, the <hi>quâ creditur,</hi> as its called, but for the Doctrine of Faith, the <hi>Fides quae creditur,</hi> the Doctrine which is believed; so that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of faith is that obedience which Faith or the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God requireth. Thus 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10 5. there is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the obedience of Christ, that is, unto Christ, and not Christs obedience subjectively: So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. The obedience of the truth is that obedience
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:118921:139"/> which the truth commands. Therefore, though many, some more openly, some more covertly would have you to consider faith as its an obedience, yet in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Justification, look upon the passivenesse of it onely.</p>
                  <p>These things premised, Let us prove this truth, <hi>That Faith justifieth not as it is a work, but only from Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by it, that faith is not in a proper sense imputed to us for our righteousnesse.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>This Argument seemeth to be very pregnant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Apostle all along this Chapter opposeth faith and works, the believer and the worker.</hi> Now his Argument would be of no force, if faith could be considered as a work, yea how absurdly would they make the Apostle to speak, <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth,</hi> that is, To him that worketh not, but worketh: And again, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is the man to whom God imputeth righteousnesse without works,</hi> that is, a work without works. <hi>Abraham belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> (that is) he worked; and thus from hence all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long prove, he was not justified by works. Certainly, this is to make the Apostle argue very imperfectly, to make two opposite members in a distinction, and then to argue from one to the exclusion of the other, when yet that is included, can never be made good Logick. None then can rationally perswade himself, That when <hi>Paul</hi> argued against works by faith, that he thought on faith as a work: So that we are not in matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification to relie on our faith, as if for that we were justified.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Faith cannot be imputed unto us for our total <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and perfect righteousnesse, because its not a perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, nor all the righteousnesse God requireth.</hi> That faith which God commands is but part of our duty, not all our duty, and then what it is, is but imperfect; for we cannot beleeve perfectly, no more then we can love God, or do other gracious exercises perfectly, <hi>We know but in part,</hi> and so can beleeve but in part. The <hi>Disciples</hi> are often reproved for their <hi>little Faith,</hi> so that they speak
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:118921:140"/> farre more consonantly to reason, though they proceed upon a false supposition, who make our faith and works perfect, at least so farre as the Word requireth. But now to say, That faith is accounted of by God for our compleat righteousnesse, when acknowledged to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and not all the righteousnesse we ought to do, is to speak a manifest absurdity, for this is to make God to judge otherwise of a thing then it is, and that he doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of things as they are. For he shall receive this, as a full debt, which indeed is not a full debt; and like that Steward in the Parable, who though he is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for wisdome, yet not for honesty, that for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound debt, bid the debtor write down fifty. Its therefore both against the wisdome and righteousnesse of God, to say, He receiveth that for a perfect righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which is not, or imputeth that to be righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which is not so. Neither may we conceive in God any such gracious condescension as to receive an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteousnesse for a perfect; for why not as well no righteousnesse at all for perfect? And why not a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pardon also coming from God without any satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> blaspheme. But the Opinionists with whom we have to deal disclaim such things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But lest this evasion should entice any away, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the third Argument is thus placed, <hi>If faith which is imperfect should because of Christs merits be graciously estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for an universal righteousnesse, then Christ did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly die for persons, but for graces, he did not die that the beleever might be saved immediately and properly, but that his faith might be accounted a formal compleat righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> Now if we observe the Scripture, that speaks uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally in this sense, <hi>That Christ died for sinners,</hi> who beleeving in him have thereby eternal life; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>Through faith in his bloud we have remission of sinnes;</hi> whereas, according to the contrary opinion, the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and proper end of Christs death should be to merit at Gods hand, That an imperfect faith should be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a full righteousnesse, and thus Christ would die
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:118921:140"/> not for persons, but for conditions. But is not this to go against the universal stream of the Scripture? Doth that any where make this the end of Christs death, that thereby God should esteem that perfect, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is not, and not rather wholly for such who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinners in themselves, yet repenting of, and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all that is theirs, do acquiesce wholly in him as a Mediator.</p>
                  <p>The fourth <hi>Argument</hi> is, <hi>If faith should justifie as it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> a work, then he that beleeveth more strongly then another, should be more justified then another, and thus our Justification should</hi> recipere magis <hi>and</hi> minus. Its true (you heard) the sense and application of our Justification may admit of degrees, but Justification it self cannot, no more then Christ can be more or lesse: One eye may see the Sunne better then another, but the Sunnes light is equal to all. Hence the Apostle argueth from <hi>Abrahams beleeving, accounted to righteousnesse, to every Christian beleeving, though never so weak and languishing,</hi> which could never be, if faith did justifie as a work, for who would not readily reply, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> example is nothing to us, we have not such a faith as <hi>Abraham</hi> had? You see how the Apostle aggravateth that, as it was a work, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>That he staggered not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row unbelief, but against hope beleeved in hope;</hi> Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Abraham</hi> produced such an high act of faith, that if you respect the object beleeved, or the manner of effecting it, all was very supernatural; This instance could not be brought to all justified persons, whose faith is very weak, and never able to put forth such strength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, unlesse its Justification was from the object, which is common to the weak Christians faith, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> well as the strong. So that by this we see, if <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith justified, as it was <hi>a work,</hi> it could not be brought as an universal Rule for all beleevers, because many attain not to such an high degree of faith, or else it would plunge many godly persons in despair, as if they could never be justified, because they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve with such strength and fortitude as <hi>Abraham</hi> did; yea, Is it not the sad temptation which many of Gods children
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:118921:141"/> have, <hi>That their faith is very weak, they find little stirrings of it;</hi> Now what an <hi>Abysse</hi> would the godly Minister cast this soul into, if he should say, Though your faith be true and sincere, yet its not active and strong enough, you must beleeve e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to <hi>Abraham,</hi> if you would be justified: were not this to give as they did to Christ, gall in stead of wine to drink?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, <hi>If faith justifieth as it is a work, or be accounted for righteousnesse, then a thing must be an instrument to it self, which is wholly absurd to conceive; for nothing can be</hi> instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; instrumentatum, <hi>it cannot be the instrument, and the thing received by the instrument, as a mans hand cannot be the treasure it receiveth,</hi> The Artificers tools are not the house he makes; the hysops sprinkling of bloud in the Jewish Sacrifice, was not the bloud or the consecration it self: So faith is not our righteousnesse, but the means to obtain it. Hence <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. its called <hi>the righteousnesse by faith,</hi> which could not be if faith were the righteousnesse, as righteousnesse by the Law did not imply the Law was accounted for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but the means by which it cometh. So then faith is no more our righteousness, then the mouth is our meat and drink. We have it by faith, it is not faith it self, nothing can be an instrument to obtain it self.</p>

                  <p>VVE have hitherto asserted this Position, <hi>That Faith as it is a work, is not imputed unto us for our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse:</hi> I shall be the briefer in it, because what Arguments overthrow works in the general, as to the matter of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the same will stand good for faith in particular only, I shall adde to the fore-mentioned,</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the fifth place, <hi>If Faith doth justifie as a work, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> then am I justified by something that is mine, it will be my righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, which yet Paul renounceth,</hi> Phil. 3.9. Although the godly mans faith be the gift of God, yet it is the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers work. Its man that believeth, and not God, and so the <hi>Just is said to live by his faith.</hi> Faith therefore though origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally coming from God, yet subjectively being a mans own
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:118921:142"/> righteousnesse, must necessarily follow, That still the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse a man is justified by, is his own, and within him. Now its good to observe, That the Scripture never saith, Faith justifieth in an <hi>active sense,</hi> but alwayes we are justified by faith in a <hi>passive sense;</hi> and what may be the reason of this, but that hereby the Scripture would exclude faith as a work? for if it did justifie as a work, then it might have properly been said, that faith justifieth: We must not then onely go out of our works, but our faith also. As the hand which <hi>Moses</hi> stretched out in working of miracles, was struck with the leprosie, to shew, that it was no efficacy in his hand, whereby those wonderfull things were wrought; So that faith which justifieth, hath even a leprosie, an uncleannesse cleaving to it, and therefore as a work cannot justifie, because that it self needeth Justification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, <hi>If Faith justifie as a work, then its no matter what the object is, so that it be a divine truth.</hi> Thus every dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal faith must be justifying. The Consequence is evident; for if the power to justifie arise not from the object of faith, but from faith as an act exercised, then wheresoever this is put forth, there Justification followeth; whereas we see the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle limits this justifying faith <hi>to Christ crucified,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Its through faith in his bloud.</hi> Now, how absurd would it be to say, That I am justified as well by beleeving that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> hanged himself, as that Christ was crucified for my offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Though the adversary wash himself with sope and nitre, yet he cannot get off this spot. Though he would seem to make Christ crucified the object of justifying faith, yea in some sense make faith an instrument to lay hold upon Christ, yet herein they speak plain contradictions to themselves, or else use such words, as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old would the word Grace, and <hi>frangendam invidiam.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the work of faith justifieth, then wheresoever this work puts it self forth, let the object be what it will be, there must Justification follow; for the work of faith lieth in captivating the understanding and heart, to what truth God hath revealed, because of his authority. And this Obedience or Submission is in one truth as well
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:118921:142"/> as in another, in respect of the motive to believe it.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>This Doctrine must needs obscure and diminish the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> worth and merits of Christ, yea Christ is hereby made onely a remote cause of our righteousnesse, not the proper and immediate one.</hi> For by this opinion, Christ by his death shall purchase at Gods hand, that our faith shall be accounted for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteousnesse; so that faith is our immediate, formal and proper righteousnesse, Christ is onely the remote cause. Thus the Papists say about the righteousnesse of works, that <hi>tincta sanguine Christi,</hi> died in the bloud of Christ, they ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie us. Works are made the immediate cause of our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, Christ the remote one; what they speak of works, to the same sense these speak of faith: But the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture saith, <hi>We are made the righteousnesse of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and its a righteousnesse imputed unto us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works: We are immediately and proximely to appear in Christ, not in our selves.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>This Position overthroweth the imputation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Christs righteousnesse unto us, it makes it wholly superfluous and needlesse, for if faith be the proper righteousnesse accepted of by God, then Christs righteousnesse done for me is needlesse;</hi> what need two Sunnes in one orb? If nature, certainly grace doth not multiply <hi>entities</hi> without necessity, and truly the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ would not in the Scripture have been so commended, had faith been that which justifieth; the crown must be taken from Christ, and put upon the head of faith; for although faith justifieth because of Christ, and he hath purchased it, yet the proxime and immediate cause hath the chiefest glory. That Christs righteousnesse is imputed to us, and so we in and by that immediately and proxime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, stand justified before God, is in its due time to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually proved.</p>
                  <p>Let us in the next place consider, what Objections are brought, either by <hi>Papists, Arminians,</hi> or others in this matter; for though upon different grounds, yet they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this, <hi>That Faith doth not justifie as a means apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or laying hold on Christ,</hi> that is but <hi>Nugae</hi> with the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants.</hi> And</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>1</label> First, They urge very speciously, <hi>That the Apostle in this fourth Chapter, doth several times say, Faith is imputed for righteousnesse, not mentioning Christs righteousnesse at all.</hi> Now say they, <hi>This is the proper place and seat of this Doctrine, therefore the Apostle would not use tropical expressions, which would rather obscure then clear the matter.</hi> Again, They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minde us of <hi>Augustines</hi> Rule, <hi>We must never go from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per literal sense, unlesse when manifest necessity doth compell, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise we shall turn the Scripture into an Allegory, and make no sure foundation of any point in Christianity; yea</hi> (they say) <hi>we cannot bring the like instance of any such phrase.</hi>

                     </label> In these things they are very confident, but for the first its granted, that this is the proper and most eminent place where Justification is handled, not in all the necessary points of it, onely what is the way, and manner how we are justified, and therefore the Apostle could not speak otherwise then he doth; for seeing the Question between the Jews and <hi>Paul</hi> was, Whether we are justified by <hi>believing</hi> or <hi>working?</hi> Its necessary <hi>Paul</hi> should conclude by believing. But then for the <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>form</hi> of our Justification, that is not directly touched upon in this place. Its not necessary that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle should speak all things requisite to the knowledge of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification in one place. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore determineth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Question stated, That it is not by working, but by beleeving that we are justified. But whether this belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving be terminated on Christs righteousnesse, was not in this place to be decided.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, It is necessary that faith should be thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>Metonymically</hi> or <hi>correlatively</hi> from other places of Scripture, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. when its said, <hi>By Christs obedience we are made righteous,</hi> when Christ is called, <hi>The Lord our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,</hi> when 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Christ is said <hi>to be made of God our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,</hi> and we said <hi>to be the righteousnes of God in him,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.21. These places do evince, that faith cannot be our proper righteousnes; for all will acknowledge we do not need two righteousnesses: then if Christ be our righteousnes, faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, and if faith, then Christ cannot be. If it be said, Christ is
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:118921:143"/> said to be our righteousnes <hi>Metonymically,</hi> or the cause is put for the effect; We urge their own Rule, they must not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the plain letter without necessity. Besides, here they acknowledge such a figurative expression used often in the Scripture, which yet they demanded an instance in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: So that the matter being brought to this, either when its said, <hi>Christ is made our righteousnesse,</hi> this must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood properly; or when faith is said to be imputed for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, this must be understood improperly, or <hi>è contra;</hi> We say there is great reason of understanding the phrase con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning faith improperly.</p>
                  <p>For the Arguments above-mentioned, to which we may add farther these considerations,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Scripture saith expressely, <hi>Christ is our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,</hi> and <hi>That we are made the righteousnesse of God in him,</hi> but it doth not say any where, <hi>That faith is imputed to righteousnesse;</hi> it saith indeed, <hi>Faith is accounted for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse to him that beleeveth,</hi> vers. 3, 5, 9, 11, 24. But there is a great difference between these two Propositions, <hi>Faith is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for righteousnesse,</hi> and <hi>Faith is accounted to him that believeth for righteousnesse,</hi> for the one speaks of faith in its own nature, and if used by the Apostle, would greatly have favoured the adversaries cause, as if faith it self had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by God for a perfect righteousnesse in its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration: But now when its said, <hi>To be accounted to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever for righteousnesse,</hi> that may imply no more, then that by his faith he doth obtain a righteousnesse; as we may say, Such a mans confidence of possessing such wealth to be given him, makes him rich, by that not intending the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it self, but his riches the object thereof make him rich.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We cannot take faith properly for righteousnesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the same Chapter, and in this discourse the Apostle distinguisheth it; Therefore the phrase must be improper, for <hi>vers.</hi> 11. its called, <hi>The righteousnesse of faith,</hi> and not <hi>Righteousnesse faith:</hi> So <hi>vers.</hi> 13. the promise is said <hi>to be through the righteousnesse of faith;</hi> for as when it is said, <hi>The righteousnesse of the Law,</hi> the meaning is not, that the Law is
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:118921:144"/> righteousnesse, but the means to it: So when its said, <hi>The righteousnesse of faith,</hi> the sense is not, that faith is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, but a means to it: So that the same Apostle, when he saith, Faith is accounted for righteousnesse to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, yet also calling it a righteousnesse by faith, doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discover that he intends not, that faith is properly accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for our righteousnesse, as if that were all we were now bound to do in the Covenant of Grace, but onely that by this faith we are made partakers of Gospel-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith must be understood as it relateth to Christ, not in it self, because that promise, in the beleeving whereof <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> is said <hi>to be justified,</hi> doth directly look upon Christ: for the <hi>seed promised,</hi> which was the object of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, is directly and expressely interpreted by the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. to be <hi>Christ;</hi> and in this sense Christ said, <hi>Abraham saw his day, and rejoyced;</hi> if therefore the object of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was not a bare promise of a temporal seed, but of such <hi>a seed in whom all Nations,</hi> yea <hi>Abraham</hi> himself <hi>was to be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> then it was not faith apprehending, but Christ apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that is our righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, It must needs be a <hi>figurative expression,</hi> because the faith that is mentioned is but one act, though indeed a very famous and remarkable one. Now how improbable is it to say, that one act meerly of faith, should stand for all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience God requireth, and be as much as if a man had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally fulfilled the whole Law? To make one act of faith, thus the whole Gospel-righteousnesse seemeth to be very ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational. Certainly, though they do much mistake that joyn faith and works together in our Justification, yet to hold faith as a work justifieth, and to exclude all other works of grace, which yet are required, seemeth to be farre more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and inconsequential.</p>
                  <p>And thus much to the first and second part of their Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we must not recede from the <hi>literal sense,</hi> especially when it is the professed handling of a truth. Although we might further adde, That thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> argueth for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral explication of <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum,</hi> because here
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:118921:144"/> Christ intended to give the true knowledge of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and that upon his death, therefore not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would darken his speech with figurative expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                  <p>As for the third part of their Objection, That we cannot shew such like phrases, where faith must be understood thus for the object. To this we answer, That faith is not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the interpretation, but it doth comprehend the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject also. We grant that by faith is meant <hi>that gracious act of the soul; only what is attributed to it, ariseth not from its work, but from the object.</hi> When we speak of Justification its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to name that motion of the soul, or means whereby we obtain it, and thus <hi>Paul</hi> doth: So that faith is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded or shut out, but its to be understood as receiving of Christ, whose righteousnesse doth justifie us. Although we may adde many such like expressions, as that, <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole;</hi> by faith is not meant faith as an act or work, but the power and strength of Christ apprehended by faith, miraculous faith was not so called, as if thereby the person was endowed with an almighty power to work miracles, but because it rested on Christs power: Even as the womans touching of Christs garment did not heal her, but the vertue that came out from him. Thus also we are said to be <hi>saved by hope,</hi> that is, by the thing hoped for. Its very ordinary in Scripture to attribute that to the habit, or act of the soul, which belongs to the object, which is the <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>adjunct</hi> for the <hi>subject;</hi> Nothing is more ordinary, so that I need not insist thereon.</p>
                  <p>Though these things seem clear, yet it is acknowledged that some Orthodox Interpreters understand faith properly; hence <hi>Gomarus</hi> in his analytical explication of this place, brings Arguments why we must understand it without any figure, and addeth, If there were a Trope to be admitted, it would be more conveniently in the predicate then in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in righteousnesse then in faith, in this sense, Faith is imputed to righteousnesse, that is, the instrumental cause of righteousnesse. But I rather encline to the more common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation I mentioned.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Whether faith may be called an instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cause of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, and in what sense.

                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:118921:145"/>
                  <p>And certainly when generally its said to be the instrument of our Justification, by that is meant no more <hi>then a means appointed by God, in the use whereof we are made partakers of Christs righteousnesse.</hi> In this sense <hi>Perkins</hi> cals faith <hi>Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum supernaturale creatum à Deo in animo hominis,</hi> whereby he layeth hold on, and applieth Christs righteousnesse to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. This is certain, That whatsoever expressions the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox use about faith in our Justification, they all agree, that this is not from any dignity of faith, or that hereby any thing is attributed to man: yea hereby they say, Man is wholly deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and wholly outed of himself, Christ being exalted all in all.</p>
                  <p>Now because this Assertion of faith justifying instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hath several censures, and that by men of contrary judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thinking that thereby we give nothing at all to faith; and others, that we give too much, hecause eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry instrumental cause is reduced to an efficient; Therefore its good to dig to the root of this matter, and although we have already said enough about faiths passive instrumentality in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, yet for further explication sake, let us adde some further consideration about <hi>Instruments,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> and they may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into <hi>Artificial, Natural</hi> and <hi>Divine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Artificial</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Artificial.</note>
                     <hi>Instruments,</hi> if we thorowly consider it, we shall finde little more then a passive habitude, or respect in them unto that ultimate effect of art, which is intended by the Artificer, and some are more passive then others: some instruments of art, have indeed a causality by a previous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing and working upon the subject, as when the Saw drawn between the wood doth expell part of it, either formally, as <hi>Scotus,</hi> or rather efficiently, as <hi>Suarez,</hi> removing it to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. In this and the like instances <hi>Artificial Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> have an efficient causality, but they are not called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi> (as <hi>Suarez</hi> well observeth) in respect of this previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous disposition, but of the ultimate effect of Art, as the Saw and hammer are called instruments, not in respect of the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or beating, but of the house or the statue and image, which the Artificer by them accomplisheth: So that if we speak of the Artificial effect intended by the Artificer, they
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:118921:146"/> are instruments onely by a passive relation, and therefore whether the Artificer make an image of a beast, or man, its all one to the instrumental tools, they incline not, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to one way more then another, which argueth they have no efficiency, as to the effect of art, in which respect they are properly called instruments. But that there are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial passive instruments appeareth plainly in musical instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are called instruments <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for in most of them its plain there is nothing but a local motion of the strings, and an artificial impression upon them by the hand, and then in respect of the melodious sound, they are thereby made passive instruments: So that I think we may almost ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally say, That artificial instruments in respect of the effect of art ultimately intended, are passive instruments, and are so called, not in respect of a causal attingency immediately of that artificial effect, but from a passive relation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, There are instrumental causes in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Natural.</note> as when the seed of a flower falling to the ground doth instrumentally produce another flower: It cannot be denied but that such, have an intrinsecal power to produce such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate effect, and such causes as these are to he reduced to the efficient, because they work by an inward connatural ability, but I suppose when Divines call faith an instrumental cause of Justification, they do not mean such a cause.</p>
                  <p>Therefore lastly, There are divine instruments, when God by his appointment and will causeth such a thing to be in the use or application of such or such means. Now these may be said to be instruments of such a mercy, not that they have any efficient causality either principal or instrumental, onely the effect is produced not by any vertue of such means used, but because of Gods appointment: and thus faith when it justifieth as an instrument, doth it as a divine, supernatural instrument, not as a natural, which will further appear in handling this Question, Whose instrument it is, whether Gods or mans? I need not say much to this: See M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                     <hi>Blake</hi> in that solid and learned Tractate of his (<hi>Vindic. Foederis, p.</hi> 81, 82.) Its there answered, That its both the instrument of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:118921:146"/> God and man, though in a different sense; and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Doctor <hi>Ames (Bellar. Enerv. Tom. quart. pag.</hi> 18.) <hi>Fides quamvis possit vocari instrumentum Dei, quia Deus justificat nos èx fide &amp; per fidem, propriè tamen est instrumentum nostrum;</hi> Its Gods instrument in a large sense, as being that which through his power is created in us, and by which he justifieth us; yet <hi>quoad actum exercitum,</hi> its properly our instrument, because its we, and not God that believeth. Its Gods instrument in respect of his institution and ordination of it for such an end. Its mans instrument, as that which is exercised and applied by him: yet though man believeth, he doth not justifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, partly because it doth not justifie as a work, but from Christ believed upon; and partly, because Justification doth not follow as a necessary, natural effect of believing, but from the gracious appointment of God, as is to be shewed in answering the next Question. Only by the way you may observe, That Justification is not attributed to faith in the same sense that it is denied to works, for those that pleaded for justification by works, did not look upon works in such an organical and relative sense, but as causes of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Apostle excluding them, doth assert faith not absolutely and in the same causality, but respectively to the bloud of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The last Question may be, <hi>If faith justifieth, How doth it come to justifie? Is Justification a necessary and natural effect of believing, or comes it meerly by the divine appointment or institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, as looking upon the brazen Serpent procured healing, not by any inward implanted force, but by the command of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to this we answer two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That faith doth not necessarily and properly produce Justification, as the fire doth burning: So that whosoever doth believe would be justified, though God had appointed no such way, though he had not made such a promise. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its a calumny cast upon the Orthodox, as if they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered any such thing, and against reason, for no habit can have two immediate proper distinct acts: If therefore to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve be the natural act of that habit, to be justified cannot
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:118921:147"/> be. Besides, Justification though it be received by us, yet is a gracious priviledge vouchsafed by God as he pleaseth, and so cannot be the natural effect of any thing within us.</p>
                  <p>Yet in the second place, Though it be Gods promise and grace to annex Justification to our believing, Our Divines do well say, That faith hath naturally a passive aptitude and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in it to receive Christ, which other graces have not. So that although this natural fitnesse be not a cause, yet the goodnesse of God makes use of it for such an end. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though one speak confidently, That when causes have a natural power to produce such effects, its improper, if not ridiculous to ascribe such effects to the will and pleasure of God, yet herein is much errour and mistake; for we say not, Faith hath a natural power to justifie, as the fire to burn (though even such natural causes in their operations are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Gods will) (for when he did not will, the raging fire could not burn those three worthies) but only it hath a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive aptitude from its nature to be ordained by God for such an end, which other graces have not; as the hand hath a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fitnesse to receive, which the head, though a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part cannot do. As in the matter of the Lords Supper, we say, the form of a Sacrament lieth in the words of Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, yet it pleased God to take such elements that have a natural fitnesse to represent the body and bloud of Christ; But the bread and wine could not do this sacramentally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an institution: so its here, though faith have such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fitnesse, as to receive and lay hold on Christ, yet that in and by this Justification shall be vouchsafed, is from the appointment of God.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we demolished those false wayes asserted by many for Justification by faith, and declared the truth with the establishment of it. I shall speak a word to the opinion of a late writer, <hi>(Justification Justified)</hi> who rejects all the former senses of Justification by faith, either as a work, or an instrument, and pitcheth upon a notion of his own: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in that whole Sermon asserted many Novelisms, <hi>Faith,</hi> he saith, <hi>justifieth, because its the first grace that doth act upon Christ, and rest upon him for Justification:</hi> But where is one
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:118921:147"/> word of Scripture attributing Justification to faith, because of this priority? The word of God relates alwayes to the object of faith, not to any such presupposed order. Besides, by this rule a man is not justified after his conversion by any acts of faith, whereby we depend on Christ, for, saith he, it justifieth, because its in order of nature, the first that acts; certainly those frequent acts of faith which the godly after their conversion put forth, are not the first in nature, yet he expresly grants, <hi>pag</hi> 16. Justification is applied to us upon the renewed acts of faith, yet these renewed acts of faith cannot be the first in order. Again, If it justifieth, because its the first that acts on Christ, then it justifieth as a work, and so fals in with those that he opposeth; If by acting on Christ, he mean receiving (for he speaks very obscurely) then he fals in with those, that say, it justifieth as an instrument, to whom notwithstanding he is an adversary. In the progresse of this reason he saith, faith justifieth only in respect of the sense and comfort, and assurance of Justification, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a great contradiction to a former passage in his Sermon, <hi>pag.</hi> 2. for he proveth the elect are not justified by God from all eternity: But why not? If faith be onely the sense of our Justification, this supposeth Justification to be before faith, and if it be but an hour before, it may be from eternity as well. Thus with him not only good works but faith also doth follow the person justified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse of Instruction,</hi> To give faith its proper place in Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, not to exalt it too much, nor yet debase it too low, but above all things nourish the actings of it, because this receiveth Christ and Justification. If a labouring man loseth his hands, he is undone, because by them he liveth; faith is this hand: The <hi>Israelite</hi> that was blinde could not look on the brazen Serpent to be healed: faith is this eye; Its faith that enricheth the soul, with one hand receiveth all from God, with the other hand sets all graces on work for God; So that we may with <hi>Gerson</hi> the Papist in a well explained sense, cry out, <hi>Oh faith, thine is the kingdom, thine is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and glory!</hi>

                  <p>We come to grapple with those, who grant our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be without us, and yet for all that hit not the mark, and that which shall be mentioned at this time, is of those, <hi>who place the whole Nature of Justification in pardon of sinne:</hi> So that with them, forgivenesse of sinne is that onely, and adequately, which maketh us just before God. But this we shall endeavour to overthrow from these words.</p>
                  <p>For the understanding whereof we may take notice of a
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:118921:148"/> two-fold priviledge spoken of, with a two-fold cause; And lastly, The original and fountain, both of the causes and their effects.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>two-fold cause</hi> is <hi>Christs death,</hi> and <hi>Christs resurrection,</hi> for although it be true, That Christs merit is limited to the time of his humiliation, yet because his resurrection did mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest his power and conquest over all his enemies (for had he not risen his death had not availed to our happinesse) hence it is that Justification is attributed to his resurrection, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we may say, Christs death is the meritorious cause both of remission of sinnes and Justification, and Christs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection is in some sense the efficient cause, because by his rising again the Spirit of God doth make us capable of, and then bestoweth Justification upon us. The <hi>two fold benefit</hi> is set down in these words,</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Christ was delivered for our offences,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the word signifieth not every light sinne, or lesse fault, but that which is a falling, hereby intimating, that Christ died to take away our great transgressions as well as lesse: Even as the read Sea overwhelmed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the great men, as well as those of more weak and infirm natures: So that hereby we see Christ crucified an expiatory Sacrifice to take away the guilt of our offences.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>second Benefit is our Justification.</hi> This is made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct benefit from the former, even as Christs death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection are distinguished, not that one can be divided from the other, onely one is not the other, or at least but a part of it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the Popish Commentators do readily expound Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification for inward renovation, That Christ rose again that we might rise to newnesse of life, but they cannot shew the use of the word in that sense, yet that Justification is more then bare remission, the Apostle doth evidently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the distinguishing of them. Now its greatly agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Divines, Why, or in what sense, Justification is thus attributed to Christs resurrection? Some explain it of the exemplar cause, and that two wayes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That as sinne hath its death by Christs death, so we
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:118921:149"/> are to have our resurrection and acceptation to life by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, insomuch that <hi>Augustine</hi> observeth, whatsoever was historically or really fulfilled in Christ, we are to have such a conformity to himself in our selves: as he was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so we are to be to the world and sinne; as he was buried, so we are said to be buried with him in Baptism; and as he rose again, so we in our souls are to arise to all holinesse of life.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, Others expresse this exemplarity after this manner, <hi>Christ</hi> (say they) <hi>in suffering was our Surety, God looked upon him as bearing our sinnes, and so we were condemned in him.</hi> Again, <hi>Christ rose as a publick and common person from the grave, and was acquitted thereupon from all the offences laid to his charge; and thus we were justified in his Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucius</hi> a learned Writer saith, <hi>Justification is therefore at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Resurrection, because it was the compleat and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate act of Christs active obedience;</hi> and from hence infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>That Remission of sinne is attributed to his passive, and Justification to his active obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others expound this of the final cause, <hi>That the expiation of our sinnes was the end of his death, and Justification the end of his resurrection, and this is most probable, Only the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous causality in his death, for our forgivenesse, and the efficient causality of his Resurrection for our Justification is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Here is the original of all,</hi> he was delivered, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Father, and he was raised, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Father. Thus whatsoever benefits comes by Christ, yea Christ himself is made the effect of his Fathers love and mercy to us: So that we have not the least reason to doubt, whether the Father will accept of what the Son hath done for us.</p>
                  <p>That which I shall pitch upon in these words is the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is made between pardon of sin and Justification, and so observe,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Observ.</note>
                     <hi>That the whole nature of Justification is not comprehended in remission and forgivenesse of sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To clear this, consider first, That there are different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:118921:149"/> not onely between the Orthodox and their Adversaries, but also amongst the Orthodox themselves in this great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of remission of sinnes; for some make Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the whole nature of it to lie in forgivenesse of sinnes. Thus <hi>Piscator</hi> and <hi>Wotton</hi> with all diligence set themselves to assert this, and many others, who deny the imputation of Christs active obedience to the believer (I say many) for some though they deny the imputation of Christs active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, yet grant Justification to be more then remission, herein forsaking <hi>Piscator.</hi> (M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                     <hi>Gatak. Animad in Luc.) Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> would charge this upon <hi>Calvin,</hi> as his different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from other Protestants, but it may be easily cleared, that <hi>Calvin</hi> doth by placing our Justification in remission of sinne, onely oppose inherent renovation against the Papists, not the imputed righteousnesse of Christ, witnesse his expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition on this Text, beside other places.</p>
                  <p>Indeed <hi>Vorstius</hi> while Orthodox doth say, <hi>(Antibel. de Justif.)</hi> If we place Justification only in remission of sins, we may the more easily answer all the Popish Objections, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall we then be so obnoxious to their malignant ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others they make remission of sinne not to be any part, much lesse the whole of Justification, but the effect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of it. Thus for the satisfaction of Christ, we being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted just before God, thereby we come to have remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes. There are learned men go this way <hi>(Bradshaw, Gataker.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Popish Writers they make remission of sinne a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant of our Justification, which they place in our internal renovation.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, There are those who make remission of sinnes an integral part of our Justification; for they say, The whole nature of Justification consists in these two parts, remission of sinne and imputation of righteousnesse; which indeed of these hath the priority, is disputed, but that is not much material. And surely if we regard the expressions of the Scripture, this seemeth to have most truth in it, and with these later, I joyn my self. Neither may it seem such an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:118921:150"/> thing to place Justification in two particulars, as if the form of it ought necessarily to be single, for we are not to speak of Justification, as natural forms which consist in <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibili,</hi> but we are to look upon it as a favour and priviledge of God, which he vouchsafeth to his children, and to the integral constituting whereof there may be as many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, as God shall put in, neither are imputation of righteousnesse, and remission of sins so disparate, but that they may well concur to one thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Wherein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins and justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on differ.</note>In the next place, <hi>Let us consider wherein remission of sinnes and Justification do differ.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>They differ as an whole and a part, Justification is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> whole, remission is a part; So that as the soul of a man and a man differ, as the whole and the part. Thus doth forgivenesse of sinne and Justification.</hi> Hence the Scripture, as it sometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth Justification by <hi>the pardon of sinne;</hi> so it doth also by the <hi>imputing of righteousnesse,</hi> Rom. 14. Neither may they be called the same thing, as the expulsion of darknesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of light, for they are two distinct benefits, and although they are inseparable, yet they are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and although where there is forgivenesse of sinne, there is imputation of righteousnesse, yet this makes not them all one, but argueth that inseparable connexion which God hath appointed; Even as remission of sinnes, and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent renovation of the soul are individually joyned together; Take one away, and you take the other; and yet they are not the same work of God, but two distinct mercies; and the reason why Justification doth comprehend these two, is, because the Apostle makes blessednesse to belong to him that is justified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being justified, we have peace with God.</hi> Now to have sinne meerly forgiven, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by Gods gracious appointment it doth <hi>de facto</hi> bring blessednesse, yet this ariseth not simply because sinne is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, but because he is accepted of as positively just, and as having done that which the Law requireth, to which onely the blessing of eternal life is promised; for who can deny but that God might have simply pardoned a sinner his sinne, and yet for all that have annihilated him, or continued his life
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:118921:150"/> for some thousands of years in temporal happinesse, and at last to have ceased to be, and not at all to give eternal life to him. As the Jews had their sinnes pardoned, were brought back to their Countrey, but not in such Glory, Power and Dignity, as formerly. Thus God (to speak of his abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power, and not what he hath promised to do) might have forgiven sinne to the humbled sinner, that is, he might have taken off the guilt or obligation to eternal punishment, and yet for all that not set the Crown of Glory upon his head; and whereas it is said, This cometh by Adoption, and not Justification, that is but <hi>gratis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> and cannot be proved, seeing that the justified man is thereby put into a full possession of Gods favour, and <hi>whom he hath justified, he will glorifie;</hi> and indeed Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is virtually all other priviledges, for they are either Effects, or Concomitants, and Consequents of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Justification doth connote a state, and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> condition of a man, and therefore is not frequently ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, although it be continued.</hi> A man is not justified ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times in a day, though sinnes be pardoned often in a day. It is true, God doth continue to justifie those that believe in him, and if he should cease to do so, they would immediately fall into misery and guilt; but yet God doth not renew or revive our Justification, as if there were an interruption or intermission of it. That Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth denote an estate, is plain by comparing it with all the other priviledges God vouchsafeth his people: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and Vocation denote a state the person is put into, so doth Glorification, As therefore Sanctification is one thing, and those auxiliary actings of Gods grace are another thing; So that though we may say, Such a man hath new quickning grace every day, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, He hath a new Regeneration: So it is here, though we may say, That every day the believer, begging the pardon of his daily infirmities, hath a new pardon, yet he hath not a new Justification, because this denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth the state of a man. Neither can it be said, That
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:118921:151"/> pardon of this sinne or that sinne, puts a man into the state of Gods favour absolutely, but <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of this or that sinne doth not make that universall righteousnesse of the person, whereby he stands acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all. It is true, some learned men call this dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remission of sinne, <hi>Justificatio particularis;</hi> but we are now treating of that universal Justification, whereby the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a believer stands acquitted, and disobliged from the guilt of all his sinnes he hath committed, and great is the comfort of a Christian in that his Justification is a state of favour with God, for hence flow many other inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable benefits and advantages, which the believer is to study out and improve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Even amongst men, we see there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between forgivenesse of sinne and Justification, one may be where the other is not.</hi> As if a man be accused be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Judge falsly for such and such crimes, and he is able to free himself before the Judge, upon this he is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, and yet we cannot say, his fault was forgiven him. Again, We see in <hi>Josephs</hi> brethren, and <hi>Shimei</hi>'s reviling of <hi>David,</hi> there was a forgivenesse of their fault, but there was no Justification of them; and although according to Gods gracious order, which he hath now established, he doth not forgive any mans sinnes proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whom he doth not justifie, that is, accept to eternal life; yet, as was said before, absolutely he might have done otherwise; So because God had vouchsafed one mercy, he was not bound to adde more, I say, forgive sinnes properly, because sometimes in Scripture the taking away of a temporal punishment, is called a forgivenesse of sinnes; and this even wicked men, as <hi>Ahab,</hi> have been partakers of, at least a delay of the punishment, when yet they have been obnoxious to eternal wrath. Its plain then, they cannot be the same, when one may be, where the other is not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>They differ in this respect, which is of great concernment, Remission of sinne doth onely take away the guilt, or ordination of it to eternal punishment, it doth not
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:118921:151"/> remove the sinne it self.</hi> So that although pardon of sinne doth make as if sinne had never been in respect of the guilt of it, yet not in respect of the denomination of the Subject. Though <hi>David</hi> had his sinnes of murder and adultery pardoned, yet that pardon did not make <hi>David</hi> a just man in those acts, his murder was truly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, his adultery was truely adultery, although the guilt and actual condemnation of them was taken away; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Justification doth denominate a man just, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is required to Justification, as well as wisdome to make a man wise, health to make a man healthfull: a man cannot be justified, <hi>viz.</hi> truely, without a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse: So that a man is not justified, and therefore just, but just and therefore justified. Its true, this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, whereby we are pronounced just, is not in our selves, because we have sinne and corruption abiding in us, but it is purchased for us by the Lord Christ, and what he hath done is accepted of, as if we had done it our own selves.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Remission of sinne and Justification differ in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> consideration. In forgivenesse of sinne there is</hi> ablatio mali; <hi>in Justification there is</hi> collatio boni: <hi>when sinne is forgiven the eternal evil deserved is removed, but when we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied eternal good is promised.</hi> Neither is it of any strength at all, to say, where all evil is removed in a subject ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable all good is introduced. If a man shall not be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he must be saved; for this is granted, that they are inseparable, but this doth not follow <hi>ex naturâ rei,</hi> but extrinsecally by the order and appointment of God; for a man might not have been damned, and yet after some enjoyments of pleasures on the earth, have been annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and never assumed to eternal glory. Certainly, when the Papists tell us of a <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> especially of their <hi>Infantum,</hi> who are neither damned, or yet ever shall be saved. Our Divines do not argue against it as an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible thing, that God might not have done so, if he would, but only they say, its against Scripture, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ods revealed will, that he will appoint such a third place.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:118921:152"/> This therefore is a perpetual mistake, That because God hath appointed these two inseparably together, freedome from hell, and enjoyment of heaven; Therefore to make them all one, and to be the effect of one act of God, As it is in Sanctification, the removing of spiritual dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and vouchsafing spiritual illumination is the same motion, with respect onely to divers terms, and this from a natural and extrinsecal necessity, but it is not thus in our Justification, he that is not damned is not from an intrinsecal necessity therefore saved, but because God hath joyned these things together. When the Papist shall urge, That wheresoever pardon of sinne is, there is infusion of righteousnesse, and shall demand us to give an instance of any such, who were forgiven, and yet not made holy; We answer, That it is freely confessed that both these are necessary concomitants; No man is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but he is sanctified, yet these are not one act and work of Gods Spirit, but distinct mercies, and wrought in a distinct manner. Thus we may see wherein the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between these two may be discovered; and that Text <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. seemeth to encline this way; for when he had said, That by Christ was forgivenesse of sinnes, he addeth, as a further priviledge, <hi>And by him all that beleeve are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the Law of Moses.</hi> But <hi>Daniel</hi> speaks more expressely, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.24. There the <hi>Messias</hi> is said <hi>to make reconciliation for iniquity, and bring in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting righteousnesse:</hi> Whether this be imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, I do not here dispute; only you see these are made two distinct benefits, expiation of sinne, and bringing in everlasting righteousnesse. And thus <hi>to abolish death,</hi> and <hi>to bring life and immortality to light,</hi> are mentioned as two distinct effects of the Lord Christ our Saviour, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. And indeed there seemeth to be great reason for it, because its not enough for us that our sinnes are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but it behoveth us to bring such a perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as the Law requireth; Now seeing we in our own persons cannot do this, that our Justification may be
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:118921:152"/> compleat and full, its necessary his obedience to the Law, should be accounted as ours. But this reason is to be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more largely, and vindicated from all opposition, when we treat of Christs active obedience.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore take into consideration what choise and special reasons are brought against this Position,<note place="margin">Reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this point exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> and why its affirmed, <hi>That all our Justification is comprised in remission of sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that which is much pressed upon, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. where the Apostle proving, That a righteousnesse is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us without works; for a confirmation hereof; alledgeth a testimony from <hi>Davids</hi> Psalm, where the man is said <hi>to be blessed that hath his sinnes forgiven him;</hi> Now (say they) the Apostles Argument would not be good, if imputation of righteousnesse, and remission of sinne were not all one.</p>
                  <p>From this manner of <hi>Pauls</hi> Argumentation; the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, Whether the Apostle give an whole definition of Justification, or describe it onely Synecdochically, one part for the whole? But there seemeth no reason why the Apostle should be here thought to describe all the nature of Justification; its enough if he brings that part of it, which will strongly and clearly prove his purpose. Now the truth <hi>Paul</hi> was to prove is, That a man is not justified by works, Why? Because <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Blessed is the man to whom sinne is forgiven, and his iniquities cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> If therefore blessednesse lie in remission of sinne, in Gods gracious favour without us, then it cannot be in any works we do. Thus the Apostles coherence is clear and evident, but whether this be all the nature of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not material, if remission of sinne be in our Justification, though it be not all of it, the Argument abideth firm. Although we may probably conclude, That the Apostle, though he onely mention pardon of sinne, yet includeth also imputation of righteousnesse, because he makes Blessednesse to consist in this remission: Now bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse and eternal life is not promised because sinne is forgiven meerly, but because there is such a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:118921:153"/> as answereth the Law, Christs doing and suffering being imputed to us, That as blessednesse is not in a mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> privation of evil, but positive affluence of all good: So Justification is not a meer blotting out of sinne, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesting us with such a righteousnesse that hath eternal life annexed to it. Neither may we wonder why the Apostle should not mention imputation of righteousnesse, as well as remission of sinnes, seeing his scope is not to inform what Justification is, but how we are justified. And again, the mentioning of one must necessarily inferre the other; for sinne cannot be pardoned unlesse a righteousnesse accepted of by God be made ours, and because of that therefore our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities to be done away; yea some presse the very mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of imputing of righteousnesse, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. as a distinct thing from remission, and yet the Apostle (they say) doth well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from one to another, because they are inseparably joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and he that hath one must necessarily have the other: Even (as some say) our Saviour proved the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, by proving the Immortality of the soul, because one followeth the other, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.32. and although they may seem to be of a different nature, yet one as a part may be well put for the whole, as the soul of a man, or the body of a man is sometimes put for the whole man.</p>
                  <p>As for the Papist, who would from <hi>Davids</hi> testimony prove inherent righteousnesse to be part of our Justification, because its added <hi>[In whose spirit there is no guile]</hi> that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, because it would directly contradict the Apostles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which is to prove a righteousnesse without works; so that those words are brought in, to shew the qualification of the subject who is justified, not a part of our Justification.</p>

                  <p>WE have asserted this truth, <hi>That Justification is not wholly comprehended in remission of sinne:</hi> And did in part answer that famous place the Adversaries so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon, <hi>viz. Pauls</hi> Argumentation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. which (say they) could not be solid were it not built upon this Rock, <hi>That imputation of righteousnesse and remission of sinne were all one.</hi> Neverthelesse because this place is accounted of like the Jebusites Fort in <hi>Zion,</hi> such a strong hold, that if you take that you take all, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.6.</p>
                  <p>I shall add some further considerations to clear this point, and some other Objections they bring (deferring the rest till we treat of Christs active obedience.) And</p>
                  <p>First, Some have thought, <hi>That the Apostle doth not argue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> from the definition to the thing defined, but</hi> ab imparium colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione; <hi>as if the Apostle had intended thus, If remission of sinne be without our works, we are not sufficient of our selves, by any thing we do to obtain pardon of sinne, much lesse can we think to be justified by any work we perform.</hi> Thus <hi>Chrysostome</hi> who from hence makes Justification to be a greater matter then meer forgivenesse. Whether this be a true analytical exposition of the place, I shall not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>spute; onely this is true, which he saith, <hi>That Justification is a greater and more noble priviledge, then meer forgivenesse of sinne;</hi> and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, Because pardon of sinne doth not make a man just,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:118921:154"/> there must be an imputation of righteousnesse to do that, and besides the removing of the guilt of sinne, we need an entituling of us to eternal glory. Hence to the former Texts mentioned, we may adde <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. where <hi>forgivenesse of sinnes</hi> and <hi>an inheritance</hi> are made two distinct benefits, and so though they alwaies concurre together, yet are never to be confounded: So that the foundation the contrary mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lay, is wholly unsound, which is, <hi>That by remission of sinne we are made righteous,</hi> which is not a truth; for (as hath been shewed) all that pardon of sinne doth, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the guilt of it, and to take away that actual ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to eternal punishment, it doth not make us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we need an imputation of the righteousnesse of Christ for this; and although upon the remission of sinne follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth eternal life and glory, yet this is not <hi>vi consequentis,</hi> but <hi>consequentiae,</hi> its not from any natural resultancy, but from Gods gracious appointment: So that <hi>Chrysostome</hi> might well argue, <hi>If by our works we cannot attain to forgivenesse of sinne, much lesse to our Justification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But in the second place grant, <hi>That the Apostle doth not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> ab imparium collatione, <hi>yet there is no necessity he should argue</hi> a definitione <hi>and</hi> definitum, <hi>as if the Apostle had here intended a full and plenary definition of Justification.</hi> There is no probable Argument for this; for if remission of sinne and imputation of righteousnesse, are inseparable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of one another, so that from the nature of the one, we may argue to the nature of the other, This is enough to confirm the Apostles intent, Righteousnesse is imputed without works: Why? because remission of sinne which it a part of our righteousnesse, that we stand justified by, is without works, as <hi>David</hi> speaks peremptorily: Whereas then its ordinarily objected, That use doth not admit, or can it be a Synecdoche to say, one part is for another, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when of a different nature.</p>
                  <p>It may be answered first, That one part is not here put for another, but a part for the whole, Remission of sinne for Justification, part of our Righteousnesse for our whole Righteousnesse, as the soul or the body are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:118921:154"/> put for the whole man. Or,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Here is not one part put for another onely, because here is an inseparahle conjunction of both these, that one is alwayes where the other is: God never forgiveth sinne, where he doth not impute righteousnesse. Therefore we may well conclude from one to the other, even as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle all along makes Justification by faith, and to be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ, or by grace, all one, because they are indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly coupled together.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Consider to the clearing of this, and all other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Objections, <hi>That to Justification there is necessarily required Justice or Righteousnesse.</hi> A man cannot be justified without righteousnesse, any more then be wise without wisdome, or holy without holinesse: So that Justice is the abstract or forme, Justification is the application or communication of it to such a Subject: As <hi>learning</hi> is a form or quality, but when applied to such a man it denominateth him in the concrete a learned man. Thus it is here, Righteousnesse is the quality, and when this is applied to a man, he is said to be made righteous or justified: Insomuch that there cannot be a true and laudable Justification, where Righteousnesse is not supposed; and hence it is, that Remission of sinne and Imputation of Righteousnesse must be two distinct things, for Remission of sinnes simply as so, doth not give a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse. It is true, that is a known saying of the Ancient, <hi>Justitia nostra est indulgentia Dei,</hi> Our Righteousnesse is Gods indulgence; but that is to be understood, because ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods appointment, these two will go together, righteousnesse and forgivenesse of sinne, not indeed our own righteousnesse, but that which God hath appointed for us through Christ.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Yet to clear this further, take notice, <hi>That till <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> we be accounted as righteous, God cannot, God will not in any gracious manner communicate himself to us, he cannot love or delight but in a righteous person.</hi> All those promises of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and familiar presence, are still to such as are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed righteous. Hence those engagements which God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to take upon himself to give everlasting happinesse, are
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:118921:155"/> alwaies to those persons that have fulfilled the Law. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life cannot be vouchsafed to any, but where the Law hath been fulfilled; Now because we could not do that, therefore Christs obedience is made ours. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>By the obedience of Christ many are said to be made righteous.</hi> Though therefore the works of the Law are excluded from our Justification in respect of our own persons, yet not as performed by Christ for us; Therefore Christ is called <hi>The end of the Law for righteousnesse to him that believeth,</hi> Rom. 10.4. Christ did not come to destroy the Law, neither in the doctrinal part, or in the obligatory part of it. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. Christ is said <hi>to come in the flesh, condemning sinne, that the Righteousnesse of the Law might be fulfilled in us;</hi> for this purpose it is that <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. Christ is said <hi>to be under the Law.</hi> Now in all these obediences unto the Law, he was not for himself; All that he did and suffered was for us, yea and in our stead: So that though we have not our salvation by that rule, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> yet Christ procured it for us, by fulfilling that, God being an holy and righteous God, never promised eternal Salvation, but to such as had obeyed his Law, either in themselves, or in their Sureties; and if Gods Justice would not dispense with a poenal satisfaction to the Law, as they themselves confesse against <hi>Socinus,</hi> Why should he dispense with the true and proper obedience to his Law, seeing that punishment is required, and become due onely <hi>per accidens,</hi> but obedience is required unto Gods Law primarily, and in it self: God then requiring a perfect Righteousnesse, and promising eternal life onely unto that, its necessary that there should be a Saviour, who should be a Saviour, who should not onely expiate our sinne, but bring in a perfect and absolute righteousnesse. It beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Adversaries of this Doctrine to prove, That God will not dispense with a poenal righteousnesse (if we may so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call it) but he will with an active righteousnesse: but of this more in its time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, <hi>If therefore God require a positive righteousnesse of us, conformable unto his Law, in the perfect obligation of it, then it followeth, that meer remission of sinne under any distinction
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:118921:155"/> whatsoever, cannot be our righteousnesse.</hi> We cannot be said to be righteous in this sense, as thereby to be interessed unto eternal life, unlesse we have either an inherent or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteousnesse. The distinctions are brought to clear their Assertion, That a man may be just meerly by remission of sinne.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They distinguish between a man Just <hi>qualitatively</hi> and <hi>legally.</hi> A man that hath his sinnes pardoned cannot be Just <hi>qualitatively,</hi> for this supposeth he hath sinned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not inherently Just; but then <hi>legally</hi> righteous a man is said to be, who though he hath offended, yet compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made to the Law. Now (say they) in this Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal pardon of sinne, a man is looked upon in and through Christ his Surety, as having satisfied the Law. Now where the Law cannot accuse, there must needs be righteousnesse. But although this be specious, yet a man cannot be called legally Just meerly because of this Satisfaction made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Remission of sinnes, for which this atonement is, doth onely take away the guilt, and the ordination of a man to punishment, as was formerly said, a man is still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just and a sinner; in respect of the filth and demerit of it, sinne doth still abide even when it is pardoned (at least original sinne.) Therefore its maintained against Papists, That forgivenesse of sin is not the aboli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion of it, that it doth not take away the <hi>Maculam,</hi> but the <hi>Reatum:</hi> If then the sinfulnesse of original sinne remain in a believer, though the guilt of it be taken away, How can eternal happinesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to such, unles otherwise they be accounted of as perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous, or having an obedience answerable to the Law? So that Remission of sinne doth not make a man legally Just in an absolute and universal sense. Indeed the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it self is necessary (though not in that sense the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours propound it,) for the Orthodox maintain against Papists, That we are not Just by a <hi>qualitative</hi> righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but a legal one; by a legal, meaning the imputed Righteousnesse of Christ, which by Gods appointment is accepted of, as if we had done it in our own persons. But remission of sinne is not all this legal Righteousnesse; for
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:118921:156"/> though by Christs death Satisfaction be made to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Law, yet not to the obedience of it; and to speak properly, a man is not obliged by way of duty to the penalty, but to the command; for we cannot properly say, Its the duty of the devils and impenitent wicked men to be damned.</p>
                  <p>Another distinction introduced much to the same purpose is, of a two-fold pardon,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A meer absolute and simple pardon, such as we are commanded to shew unto others, of which the Lords Prayer speaketh.</p>
                  <p>Or secondly, A pardon acquired by Satisfaction, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a just compensation. Now its true (say they) That in meer simple pardons there cannot be any Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, yea the contrary is there supposed, but in pardons by Satisfaction, thus is a righteousnesse procured: But this will fall to the ground upon the same reason with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, pardon by Satisfaction would be a compleat righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, if that were all, which is required; if so be that Christ had procured such an atonement, that the Law should be no longer obliging of us, that we should be free from all obedience, that the Law should cease to be a Law to us, then this Satisfaction would be our full Righteousnesse. But Christ died not for this end, to disoblige us from God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther though he satisfied the comminatory part of the Law, did he therefore invalidate the mandatory part? And who in reason can think, that because man fallen is redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Saviour, that therefore the Law should not still continue prescribing obedience unto it? But I must not anticipate my self, for this is to be more fully cleared hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, <hi>Although we say Remission of sinne doth not make a man Just, yet it is not necessary that we should assign a third, or a neutral estate of a man, that is neither just nor unjust.</hi> For this is perpetually urged, as a grand absurdity, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse takes away the guilt of sinne, and freeth from hell, and yet it doth not make a man just, nor entitle to heaven.</p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:118921:156"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore</hi> (say they) <hi>a man may be in Gods account,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>neither a sinner, nor yet a righteous person, neither in the state of death nor life, whereas these are immediate contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and so in a subject capable one must necessarily be put. As in the air, there must be light or darknesse, a man must be either alive or dead. Its true, where the subject is not capable, there neither of these immediate contraries are inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: A beast is neither just nor unjust; A stone is neither sinfull or holy, because these are not subjects susceptible of such qualities; But man is the proper and immediate subject, and therefore we may conclude, If not a sinner, then just; If not to be damned, then to be saved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Argument they much triumph, this is the <hi>Goliahs</hi> Sword. But</p>
                  <p>First, We do not <hi>(de facto)</hi> say, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> there is or was any such neutral and indifferent state, wherein men were neither righteous nor unrighteous, neither damned or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Indeed the Papists they speak of mans pure naturals, such an estate wherein he is neither good nor evil, till by his free-will he made himself so; and thus they say, <hi>Adam</hi> was created, and therefore original Righteousnesse was su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, and put as a bridle to him, to keep the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our part from rebelling against the Superiour. And the <hi>Socinians</hi> they tell us, of a middle and neutral state <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was created in, which they call innocency, as if he had no more knowledge or understanding in him, then a meer childe. And for a middle state between heaven and hell, The Papists do <hi>(de facto)</hi> assigne, by their <hi>Limbus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum</hi> and <hi>Infantum;</hi> Yea all those in Antiquity, which are thought to be many, that hold the souls did not go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into heaven; and such as of later dayes that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Psuchopannuchia,</hi> they do hold, That for a time at least there is a state wherein the godly are neither ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy or miserable. And the <hi>Socinians</hi> do <hi>(de facto)</hi> also give a middle estate between <hi>Poenam damni</hi> and <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> and that is a state of annihilation. Thus you see there have been, and are of late, who thought it no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imaginable thing, to make such an estate actually to be.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:118921:157"/> Now if you change, the Question, and make it not, Whether God hath appointed such a middle state and condition (for it is plain he hath revealed the contrary) but, Whether by his absolute power he could not have done it, there would not a negative answer be hastily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, There are many things are not the same in their essence, and yet for their existency are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable; so that it would be unreasonable to demand the separation of them. Do not those of the contrary Judgement say, Remission of sinne and inward Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not the same things, that they are two distinct benefits? Yet if the Papists should demand of them, that they should assigne such a middle estate, of one whose sinnes are truly pardoned, and yet not inwardly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would not the answer be, They are inseparable in their existence, though distinct in their essence? Thus a substance is really distinguished from its accidents, yet we say against the Papists, that it cannot subsist without them, though they run to Gods power to maintain their miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Transubstantiation.</p>
                  <p>To instance in a third thing, Doe not the Orthodox say, That faith alone justifieth, though it be not alone, that its not <hi>Solitaria,</hi> though <hi>Sola</hi> in the act of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? This being the truth of God, we matter not the Papist expostulating, Why faith may not be separated from charity? What repugnancy this is for faith being divided from other graces to justifie? By these instances we see, that its no new thing, for several things to be indispensably and individually conjoyned together: So that we cannot say, one can be without the other, though we may true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, one is not the other. Thus though to have sinne forgiven, cannot according to the order God hath now esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, be without righteousnesse, yet that is not because they are the same thing in nature.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, But that which we conceive to be the full and plenary answer is, That righteousnesse and sinne, life and death, in the sense controverted, are not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:118921:157"/> and naturally contraries: But in a moral sense, by the appointment and arbitrary Will of God; so that if he had pleased, he might have ordained it otherwise: So that Righteousnesse and sinne, though in a Subject capable, are not naturally contrary, as light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is, crooked and straight, naturall life and naturall death, which in their proper Subjects do necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the existence of one at that time; if it be not day, it must be night; it is not one motion that makes the stick straight, and another not crooked; he that takes life from a man, doth thereby necessarily kill him, it cannot be hindred. But it is not thus in the state controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because</p>
                  <p>In the first place, Remission of sinne doth not make a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> man no sinner, perfect Sanctification doth this, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteousnesse. It hath been often said, That by forgivenesse of sinne a man doth not cease to be a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but to be obnoxious to eternall punishment: So that to be righteous in the controversie, is not to have habituall Holinesse, to which sinne is an immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but to be judged righteous by the Obedience which another hath done for us. Hence it is, that while a man is accounted of by God, as righteous through Christ, yet at the same time he hath sinne and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption cleaving to him, which God seeth and chastiseth him for: So that, as is to be shewed, it is but a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny to fasten that <hi>Antinomian</hi> Position, Of God see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no sinne in his people, upon the Doctrine of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteousnesse. This Viper can no more cleave to that, then to the Doctrine of Satisfaction by the death of Christ, as is more largely to be shewed.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, Though life and death be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in a naturall consideration, yet the life and death understood in the controversie, are made contraries one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Gods appointment, and so they are opposite by an externall appointment; for the life we speak of is that heavenly and glorious life which God of his goodnesse
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:118921:158"/> will bestow on those that are his, and therefore cannot follow by naturall resultancy upon the death removed, that God hath threatned; for though God in Mercy would not damne a man, yet it doth not necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, That therefore he must give him such a life, as that glorious being in Heaven; for either he might have destroyed him, or if he had perpetuated his life, it might have been, as some Divines say, <hi>Adam</hi> would have been partaker of, had he continued in Obedience, <hi>(viz.)</hi> an happy blessed life here on earth: So that though our life and our death, which are natural, be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate contraries, yet the eternall death and eternall life are so from the appointment of God only, and then no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, seeing they are two distinct benefits, if they be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by two distinct causes.</p>
                  <p>To these things we may adde that instance of <hi>Adam,</hi> which the learned mention; for <hi>Adam,</hi> though he was not indeed created in a middle neutrall estate, but after the Image of God in Holinesse, yet though free from the guilt of sinne, he had not a right to eternall life, for that was upon his perfect and persevering Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: So that in him we have a clear proof, That a man may be without the guilt of sinne, he was not in a state of wrath, and yet he was not entituled to Heaven, and eternall Glory. And this is acknowledged in effect by the Adversary, who saith, That eternall Glory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not by Justification, but Adoption, then all their own Arguments will be retorted upon themselves; for by Remission of sinne a man is delivered from all evil, and yet this is not enough to make him happy without A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption: They may as well say, All Adoption lieth in Remission of sinne, as well as all Justification. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they deny this eternall life to be by Justification, yet the Apostle doth expressely attribute it to this priviledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. where it is called <hi>Justification to life:</hi> So that as condemnation doth include eternal death, thus Justification must eternal life.</p>

                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:118921:159"/> because he was <hi>circumcsed;</hi> in this verse he sheweth, That <hi>Abraham</hi> received the sign of this righteousnesse of faith, while he was <hi>uncircumcised,</hi> and therefore circumcision and uncircumcision did not vary this matter.</p>
                  <p>In the words then we have <hi>Circumcision</hi> described:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the general nature of it, <hi>A sign and seal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the signified grace, <hi>The righteousnesse of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the subject, <hi>Abraham received it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. From the exemplarity of this, this did not belong to <hi>Abraham</hi> alone, but to believers, both circumcised and uncircumcised, <hi>That righteousnesse might be imputed to them also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though learned men do much discusse the former part, founding the true Nature and Definition of Sacraments thereupon, yet my purpose is onely to insist on the last clause, <hi>(viz.) That righteousnesse may be imputed to them also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wonder not, if for the demonstration of the Nature of Justification, most of my Texts are taken out of this Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> for here is the proper seat of that Doctrine; and therefore <hi>Melancthon</hi> was wont to call the Epistle to the <hi>Romans, The Confession of the Reformed Churches.</hi> Now this fourth Chapter doth expresly speak of an imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, its no where so evidently and purposedly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, as in this place; for the Apostle doth at least eight times mention this phrase of imputing or accounting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes: what is implied in this phrase, shall be opened in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Doctrine, which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the righteousnesse the believer hath is imputed.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                     </label> It is an accounted or reckoned righteousnesse to him, it is not that which he hath inherently in himself, but God through Christ doth esteem of him as if he had it, and so deals with him as wholly righteous. This is a <hi>Passive</hi> righteousnesse, not an <hi>Active</hi> righteousnesse; a righteousnesse we receive, not that we do. To understand this, consider many Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That this Doctrine of imputed righteousnesse is by all erroneous persons judged to be like the abomination of desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:118921:160"/> Howsoever heretical persons contradict one another in other thing, yet against this they are unanimously conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Its well enough known what reproaches and mocks are put upon it by the Popish party, calling it the putative and chimerical righteousnesse. The <hi>Socinians</hi> they abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it. The <hi>Castellians</hi> flout at it, saying, they have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted learning, and imputed modesty, that hold imputed righteousnesse. The <hi>Arminians,</hi> though they grant faith to be accounted for righteousnesse, yet to say, Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse to be imputed to us, they think to be an Idol of the Protestants brain, and say, Its no where expressed in Scripture. But no wonder that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> (as I may so say) should rise up against it, when the <hi>Israelites</hi> fight against one another concerning it; of which more in its time. Let this satisfie us, That the Scripture doth thus oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en mention an imputed righteousnesse, and therefore should not be matter of reproach, but worthy of all acceptation; and certainly, seeing none of us have such an inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse within our selves, as is able to endure before so perfect and holy a God; We ought greatly to rejoyce in the goodnesse and mercy of God, who hath provided such glorious robes for us, that when we were wholly naked and undone, yet hath procured a righteousnesse for us, that neither men or Angels could bring about.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Consider that the word answering this imputing, is in the Hebrew</hi> Chashab, <hi>and in the Greek</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>of which the summe, (as the learned say comes to this,) That though the words in the general signifie to think, to reason, to imagine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet very frequently it is used to account or reckon by way of computation, as Arithmeticians use to do; so that it is, as it were, a judgement past upon a thing, when all Reasons or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are cast together.</hi> And from this its applied to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any kinde of accounting or reckoning; and in this sense, imputation is taken here for Gods esteeming and accounting of us righteous. Therefore when the <hi>Osiandrists</hi> make <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putare,</hi> to be as much as the <hi>insition</hi> or putting of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse into us, as <hi>amputare</hi> is to cut off; or the Papists to make it an infusion of holy qualities, they go as farre
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:118921:160"/> from the sense of the word, as the East is from the West.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Although some learned men are very prolix and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> large in distributing of this imputation, and making several kindes of it, yet that which is most proper and fit to our controversie in hand, is, <hi>That to impute, is to account or rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon to a man such a thing, or cause of it, which he hath not, or hath, whether it be good or evil.</hi> Imputation doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes imply an absence, or a want of the thing, as <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> would have it; nor is it alwayes of that which is good and blessed, it may be of that which is evil, and to be punished, sins are imputed as well as righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Now a sinne or the evil of it,<note place="margin">Sinne may be imputed two wayes.</note> may be imputed two wayes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Justly and righteously, when any man hath indeed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> committed such a sinne that is imputed to him; <hi>Cains</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Abel</hi> was imputed to him, and thus every man, till God pardon his sinne, it is imputed to him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. All impenitent sinners have their sinnes imputed to them, though others, or they themselves will not reckon themselves sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet God will; and this imputation of sinne after a just manner may be, when a man though he hath not expressely sinned such a sinne, yet by interpretation, or some other equivalent respect, he is said to do it. To this purpose may be brought that place discussed so much by Interpreters, <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.4. where the word saith, <hi>That if a man kill any Ox or Lamb for an offering, and doth not bring it to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, bloud shall be imputed to that man, he hath shed bloud;</hi> That is, say some Expositors, That if a man do not keep to Gods order and command in the Sacrifices and worship he appointed, it is as hainous a sinne, as if he had committed murder, as if he had killed a man; and this imputation by way of equivalency, is often amongst men.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, There is an imputation of evil, or the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> cause of it unjustly, when that is accounted upon a mans score, which yet he is not guilty of. Thus <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>They laid to his charge things he never did;</hi> and thus evil Judges
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:118921:161"/> when they condemn the innocent, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did Christ, and the Jews charging him with such crimes that he was not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, did impute sin unjustly.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, There is an imputing or accounting a good thing unto a man,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Justly and righteously, as when the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>To him that worketh, his reward is reckoned of debt.</hi> Thus if there were any perfect fulfillers of the Law, eternal glory would be reckoned unto them, as the just reward of their labours.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is an imputation of good unjustly and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and that is, when an ungodly Judge shall acquit a guilty person against Law, or as when the <hi>Israelites</hi> did impute all the plenty and abundance they had to their Idolatry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did worship the Queen of heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is an imputation by grace, which is, when righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and reward is accounted to an offender, not of debt, but of grace, yet having just and weighty causes for such an absolution and Justification. And this is the proper way of our Gospel-imputation. He that is ungodly (as the Apostle speaketh) <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. is justified, God doth account him as righteous, though a sinner in himself, not of debt; for, How can he that deserveth to be damned, deserve to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but of meer grace? yet that this grace might have a free passage, and not impeach his justice and holinesse, Christ became an atonement for us, and made himself an expiation for our sins, and hereby God might appear both merciful and just. This is the righteousnesse imputed, that a believer is wholly to rest upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>The Scripture speaketh but of a two-fold imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in reference to our matter in hand, an imputation of debt, and an imputation according to grace.</hi> This distinction you have <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. <hi>To him that worketh the reward is accounted of debt.</hi> Though some may think that imputation is here taken improperly, yet that is upon a false supposition, as if impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation did alwayes suppose some <hi>indebitum</hi> where it was: but that is not so, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Paul</hi> there prayeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning such who forsook him, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that it be not
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:118921:161"/> laid to their charge,</hi> that it be not <hi>imputed</hi> to them. 2. The Apostle mentioneth an imputation of grace, and that is most remarkably seen in the Gospel, our sinnes being imputed to Christ, and his righteousnesse to us, God doth not absolutely and simply of meer grace pronounce us righteous, but Christ is become our Surety, and so as in the first <hi>Adam</hi> we are made sinners; thus in the second <hi>Adam</hi> we are made righteous; This is the wonderful grace of God, herein were the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold riches of his wisdome seen, that when we were neither able to satisfie the penalty of the Law, or to bring a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to it, Christ interposeth, and is become both redemption and righteousnesse for us.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Hence in this Imputation of Christs righteousnesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> unto us,</hi> There are these things observable,<note place="margin">In the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs righteousnesse these things are observable.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is no foundation or cause within us of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;</hi> when God doth account or reckon us as righteous, then he findes not any thing in us, neither is it because of any foundation we have laid, it is wholly from without us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> even from Christ;<note place="margin">Nothing in us wherefore God should account us righteous.</note> and this should teach us in that great and noble priviledge of Justification, to fix our eyes and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more without us; What is the reason that every belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not with the Church in the <hi>Canticles</hi> ravished with Christ, accounting him as the <hi>chiefest of ten thousand,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes languishing and breaking in desires after him? Even because we dwell in our selves, we rest in our selves, we would have a bottom, whereupon to stand and not be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Christ only: When an earthly Judge shall justifie a man, he must have a foundation in the man, else he is an abomination to the Lord: but God, though he doth not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie without a righteousnesse, yet the foundation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is not laid by our selves, but it is Christ that beareth up all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It is so farre, that there should be any foundation sought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for in us, that there is the clean contrary.</hi> When God justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he might justly condemn, if we regard what is to be found in us, which makes the Apostle call <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject justified an ungodly man, <hi>viz.</hi> one that is not absolutely and perfectly righteous: Insomuch that we may justly stand
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:118921:162"/> and admire the wisdome of God, who hath taken such a way to justifie us, as to keep us in a perpetual fear and trembling: for while looking into our selves, we see nothing but matter of death and condemnation, God at the same time giveth immortality and glory. This is the reason why the Scripture so often cals it <hi>the grace of God,</hi> because it is bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such who are unworthy, and that have nothing in themselves, but the desert of hell, and eternall venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>Hence it is that this Imputation lieth in a relative respect of Gods knowledge and will to us.</hi> For seeing that Christ by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact and agreement with the Father, undertook our debt, and promised to expiate sin, and bring about an eternal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, when Christ had fully discharged this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and nothing more was to be laid to our charge, then doth God the Father judge as, and account us to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and indeed herein lieth the infinite comfort and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Christian, that it is God himself who imputeth this righteousnesse, therefore what he accounteth to be must be, and shall stand, <hi>Its God that justifieth,</hi> and no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can stand against his counsel.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>Though this Imputation be thus relative in Gods purpose towards us, yet it is real, it hath a most sure and solid being.</hi> For that is the daily cavilling of the Adversary, as if we made some <hi>Idea</hi> and meer figment, an <hi>Ens</hi> that did neither subsist in God, or Christ, or in our selves. But though it be in Gods minde and will with a relative respect to us, yet it is real and substantial, it is not a meer notion or fancy: for, as you heard, the foundation of it is real, the obedience of Christ; and can there be a surer Rock then this? So the cause of it is real, Gods will and Covenant to accept of what Christ did, as if we our selves had done it. Its not then <hi>fictio Juris,</hi> or a meer imagination, but there is a real paiment, and a full discharge, which is abundantly able to make us righteous; and although some Divines do divide Imputation into <hi>real</hi> and <hi>rational,</hi> making the Gospel-imputation to be a <hi>rational</hi> or <hi>mental Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi> that is not to be understood, as if hereby they made it a meer fancy or fiction, only we are not really righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:118921:162"/> to be justified in our selves, but its a translation, as it were of Christs righteousnesse to us, by Gods will and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let not the believer then, while he would satisfie his soul with this imputed righteousnesse, be afraid this is onely some pleasing dream, or an humane fiction; but let him look upon it as that which stands upon a sure foundation, as the heavens and earth do. For what is it that keeps thee from falling into nothing but Gods Will and Power? And is not the same Will of God farre more interessed in this imputed righteousnesse? Fear not then that this beam will break un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy arms: All the believers that ever have or shall be, may lean on this, and not sink under them: Its real, sure and solid, though it be imputed, which doth also appear in the real and lively effects thereof, it brings peace, joy and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting consolation to such as partake of it; It makes them <hi>glory in tribulations,</hi> and <hi>triumph over all adversities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>In this Imputation we are to consider the thing it self, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the cause and the effect, for all these are accounted to us.</hi> The thing it self is righteousnesse, what is more necessary then this to a sinner? For if you do respect God, he is holy and righteous, aod loves onely righteousnesse: if you do regard the Law of God, that commands only righteousnesse, both in the root and branches; if heaven and glory, that is onely provided for righteous persons. Oh then! What can a poor sinner do without righteousnesse? This then should rejoyce the humbled sinner, that in that very thing he is so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid and troubled, God hath provided a remedy. A righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse thou dost want more then food, raiment, or any earthly comfort in the world, and therefore behold the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous kindnesse of God, who hath thus provided one for thee. 2. There is the cause of this righteousnesse, and that is Christs obedience, for its no contradiction, That Christs obedience should be both the meritorious cause of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and our material righteousnesse likewise, or that matter, which imputed to us, makes us righteous: God then looketh upon us, as if we had done and suffered all that Christ did; and although it seem very harsh to some, to say, That God looketh upon Christs fulfilling the Law, as if we
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:118921:163"/> had fulfilled it, and as if we had done compleat obedience unto it, yet there is no just reason to be offended at this, no more then to say, That God looked upon us in Christ satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his justice, as if we had done it, or thus to say, Christ is our Surety, Christ is the second <hi>Adam.</hi> And then lastly, The effect of this righteousnesse is accounted to us, and that is, we have now a right to eternal life, we now have boldness unto the throne of grace, we have liberty to come before God, there is nothing to be objected against us, we may not fear any arrests or accusations: Oh what tongue of men or Angels is able to expresse the happinesse of this man, who hath imputed righteousnesse! By this imputation they are what Christ their Surety is, God looks upon them as having Christs lovelinesse and perfumes upon them. This is true, and no <hi>Antinomian</hi> Positions can be inferred from hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, <hi>In this Imputation of righteousnesse, because it is necessarily conceived to make a relative change, it hath a term</hi> from which <hi>and</hi> to which; <hi>or as some learned men expresse it, there are two manners of this Imputation, whereof the one is called Negative, the other Positive. The Negative Imputation, is, the not imputing of sin, sin is not charged upon us. The Positive is an affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or reckoning of righteousnes.</hi> Thus some would make it the same motion, distinguished only from the several terms it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth unto. But as we have shewed before, there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, yea a necessity to make remission of sin and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of righteousnesse two distinct things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighthly, <hi>If in this Imputation of righteousnesse there seem many things absurd to carnal reason, its not therefore to be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as not being the truth of God.</hi> The Doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or the Resurrection of the dead, Is it not very incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to flesh and bloud? Yea doth not the <hi>Socinian</hi> cry down an imputed Satisfaction with as much confidence as these can an imputed righteousnesse in the sense explained? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Socinians</hi> do equally reject both: Was it ever heard, say they, that another mans innocency or obedience should be accounted unto a man as his own? They will grant that in civil things, another mans money may be accounted as mine, but that another mans obedience should be judged
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:118921:163"/> mine, this they abhor. But as the Lord Christ is called <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,</hi> Isa. 9. so is every thing in him, and that comes from him, wonderful: his natures are wonderful, his offices, and the effects thereof are exceeding wonderful. Therefore, though the <hi>Socinians</hi> call it <hi>absurdum, impium, intolerabil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> yea as that which doth contain a manner of our Salvation ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring from the holy Scripture, and all humane sense, yet be not staggered at it, for the whole way of our redemption is carried on in a mysterious way. Indeed we are not to make mysteries and wonders, where the Scripture doth not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert them, but when it doth, there we are firmly to adhere to them.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>This Imputation of Christs merits and obedience, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> is so necessary, that (except the Socinians) it is acknowledged by all in one sense or other. Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Becanus,</hi> with the other Papists grant, There is in some sense an imputation of Christs righteousnesse to us; so do the <hi>Arminians,</hi> yea most of those who deny the active obedience of Christ imputed to us. But this certain sense they allow it in, doth not arise to the full dignity and worth that is to be attributed unto Christ in this particular; for its but a remote or virtual imputation, not a proxime and formal one. They explain themselves thus, That Christs merits are so made ours, that by them we receive grace and power to merit. Thus the Papist. Therefore they grant an application, communication and imputation of what Christ did unto us in this remote sense. So the <hi>Arminians</hi> with their consociates, They grant an union and communion with Christ, They grant, what Christ did may be applied and imputed to us, but in this sense, that is, for our benefit, for our good; so that through his death either faith should be accounted of as a full righteousnesse, or else all righteousnesse be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in remission of sinne. But that his righteousnesse should be imputed to us, so as to be made ours, and that in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience we are to stand perfect before God: This is a Camel to them that they cannot swallow. But when the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21. as also <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> makes a comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>our sins laid on him,</hi> and <hi>his righteousnesse made ours,</hi> as also a resemblance between the <hi>first Adam</hi> and the <hi>second A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi>
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:118921:164"/> this cannot but prove more then a remote or virtual imputation.</p>

                  <p>Eleventhly, <hi>Christs righteousnes is not properly the form of our Justification, but Gods imputation of it.</hi> For seeing that Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is an act of God, it must be something without us that is the form of it, and that is both remission of sin and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of righteousnesse.

                  <p>Let us from these premisses with all thankfulnesse admire the grace of God, who hath not left us without a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and that a more noble and worthy one then ever we lost. It is much if our hearts do not alwayes burn like fire in the meditation of it: But it is because we are carnal, sold under sinne, not knowing how ill and dreadful our estate is: till therefore that good hour come, wherein God will make known unto us, that dunghill and hell which is within us, we can never esteem this imputed righteousnesse: Oh pray for that Spirit which shall convince of sinne and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse also!</p>

                     <q>That Righteousnesse might be Imputed to them also.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>VVE have laid down several Propositions to clear this Doctrine about imputed righteousnesse; Let us now consider what Arguments may be brought to establish it. And</p>
                  <p>First, This present Chapter will evidently confirm it, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> where Imputation of righteousnesse is so often mentioned, <hi>The Scripture cals it several times an accounted or imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse: Now if it be an imputed righteousnesse, it must be either our own or anothers. It cannot be our own</hi> for these Reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because its a righteousnesse imputed without works; if then it were our own righteousnesse, it must be by works; but we are passive in our Justification, not active; we are not to look into our selves, but on Christ without us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It cannot be our own righteousnesse imputed, because this is made to be of the like nature with remission of sinnes. Now its plain, That remission of sin is not any work of ours, but a gracious favour and act of Gods.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:118921:165"/>3. It cannot be our righteousnesse that is imputed, because the subject who is here said to be justified, is called an ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, one that hath not such a perfect and compleat righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse that the Law requireth; if then a man hath it not of his own, it must be anothers that is accounted to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It cannot be our righteousnesse that is imputed, for then it would be an imputation of debt, and not of grace. Thus the Apostle argueth <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. <hi>To him that worketh the reward is accounted of debt, not of grace.</hi> For although to work be of grace in a sanctified person, yet so farre it is of debt, as it is a work done by us. But the Apostle in this point doth attribute all to grace, giving it the <hi>Alpha</hi> and the <hi>Ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi> the beginning and end of all. If therefore it be not ours that is imputed, whose can it be but Christs? and that it is Christs appeareth by <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.19. <hi>By one mans obedience shall many be made righteous;</hi> and at the 24<seg rend="sup">th</seg> verse in this Chapter, <hi>It shall be imputed to us also, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.</hi> Thus this Chapter seemeth to give clear light in this Point. As for those who would make the very work of beleeving the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>credere,</hi> to be the imputed righteousnesse; that hath been sufficiently confuted already. Onely let us hear what may probably be replied. <hi>Socinus</hi> considers the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and saith, the word is either used <hi>simpliciter</hi> and absolutely in it self, or relatively; if sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in it self, then it signifieth no more then to have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or regard of a thing, as when God is said not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute sinne, that is, not to take notice of it, not to put it in his account to punish it. And it is readily granted, that the Hebrew word doth sometimes signifie thus, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.4. <hi>What is man that thou art thus mindfull of him?</hi> There is the same Hebrew word.</p>
                  <p>But in the next place, it may be understood relatively, where the Proposition <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>in</hi> or <hi>ad</hi> is understood, and then he saith it is not to be translated <hi>imputata,</hi> but <hi>reputata.</hi> But this is a meer logomachy, for we take to repute and impute all one in this sense, although indeed when it signifieth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute or account strictly taken, its put absolutely, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:118921:165"/>
                     <hi>Account your selves dead to sinne,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.1. <hi>Let a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or judge of us, as the Ministers of the Gospel. Sanderus</hi> the Jesuite (<hi>Lib. de Justif. pag.</hi> 50.) refuseth this translation of the word, because the Apostle when he would use a word to signifie <hi>impute,</hi> he useth a compound word, not a simple one, as <hi>Philem. vers.</hi> 18. <hi>If he have wronged thee, put that on mine account,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Thus <hi>Romans</hi> 5.13. sinne <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is not imputed without the Law; but this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation is not universal, for the simple word is used, where imputation must necessarily be understood, as <hi>Mark</hi> 15.28. <hi>He was accounted amongst transgressours,</hi> What is that? But sinne was imputed to him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26. <hi>His uncircumcision shall be accounted to Circumcision.</hi> There is the simple word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>But its further objected, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                     </label>
                     <hi>That though righteousnesse be said to be imputed, yet not Christs righteousnesse,</hi> Proferant vel unum locum, <hi>&amp;c. Let them bring but one place, say</hi> Bellar. Socinus, <hi>where Christs righteousnesse is said to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that we answer, That its necessarily implied, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is said to be imputed, and that cannot be our own, as the context hath cleared; and besides, <hi>Its Christs obedience by which we are made righteous, yea we are made the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God in him.</hi> And therefore it cannot be any other righteousnesse but that; and whereas its said, it would be a kinde of blasphemy to say, Christs righteousnesse is imputed to us for righteousnesse, as if that were not of it self perfect and compleat, but needed a gracious imputation or accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This ariseth from a mistake; for we say not, That Christs righteousnesse is imputed to be a righteousnesse, as if that of it self were not so, onely there needed some graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous condescension on Gods part to accept of it for us. But we say, its imputed to us for righteousnesse, that whereas we needed a righteousnesse, and had none of our own; what Christ did, is as if we had done it in our own persons.</p>
                  <p>A second <hi>Argument</hi> shall be drawn <hi>from that notable colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>2</label> the Apostle makes with Christ the second Adam, and the first
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:118921:166"/> Adam,</hi> Rom. 5.12, 17, 18. where the Apostle doth thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, <hi>That as all men are made sinners by Adams sinne, so all believers are made righteous by Christs obedience.</hi> Now how is <hi>Adams</hi> sinne made ours? Is it not by imputation? Indeed by his sinne we come also to have inherent corruption, and this is propagated to every one; and this is called <hi>originale peccatum originatum,</hi> but then <hi>Adams</hi> actual sinne is ours by imputation, and this is called <hi>originale peccatum originans,</hi> therefore at <hi>vers.</hi> 12. its said, <hi>In whom we have sinned,</hi> or if we translate it, <hi>In as much as we have sinned,</hi> it comes all to one; <hi>Adams</hi> sinne must needs be ours by imputation; for what reason can be given, why the sinnes of all Parents are not made their childrens, as well as <hi>Adams</hi> is made ours? but because of the Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and so all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde in him. Indeed <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth this Argument against the Orthodox, and he frameth it thus, <hi>As through Adam all are made sinners inherently through corruption dwelling in them; so through Christ all are made righteous inherently by an inward renovation of the minde.</hi> Now all this may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as part of truth, but the Apostles comparison is to be extended further; Neither doth he so much intend the sinne that is in us, as that we were guilty of in <hi>Adams</hi> disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: So that here we see the Apostle mentioning two common persons or representatives, and what they do is to be attributed to all that are contained in them. Thus as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> imputed sin is the cause of all our inherent corruption; so Christs imputed righteousnesse is the fountain of all our inward happinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, <hi>Christs righteousnesse is made ours, as our sinnes were made his, and that is onely by imputation.</hi> This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seemeth to be built on a Rock, even that Text 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. He was made sinne for us, that we might become the righteousnesse of God in him; He was made sinne for us;</hi> How is that but by imputation? <hi>For he was reckoned amongst trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours, and God laid upon him the iniquity of us all.</hi> So that although in himself there was not found <hi>any guile,</hi> and he was the unspotted Lamb of God, yet as he was our Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and bore our sinnes, so our iniquities were impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:118921:166"/> to him, and he bore the wrath of God, because of them.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, That by sinne is meant a Sacrifice for sin, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the usual phrase of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>It is answered, first, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> There is no necessity of taking it in that sense, yea the context seemeth to encline another way, for in the same verse is added, <hi>He who knew no sinne, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came sinne;</hi> Now sinne in the former place is taken properly, so that the expression would lose its grace; if in the later place it be not also taken properly. Again, <hi>sinne</hi> is opposed to <hi>righteousnesse</hi> in the Text, <hi>he became sinne that we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come righteousnesse;</hi> But <hi>sinne</hi> as it is <hi>sinne,</hi> not as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> doth in its proper nature <hi>oppose righteousnesse;</hi> Neither doth it at all tend to Christs dishonour to expound it so, seeing the Prophet of old said, <hi>God had laid our iniquities upon him,</hi> which must necessarily be understood of <hi>sinnes as sinnes;</hi> and indeed the more Christ was humbled, debased, and this argued his greater love, and did the more exalt his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torship.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, Grant that (sinne) be taken for the Sacrifice for sinne, yet still the Argument stands valid, <hi>For he could not be made a Sacrifice for sinne, if sinne were not imputed to him.</hi> When the Sacrifice of the Old Testament was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the laying on of hands upon it, did signifie the translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the sinnes of the person offering, upon the beast to be sacrificed; and thus it was with Christ, who was typified by those Sacrifices, as the Apostle sheweth at large. Therefore though it be granted, that the sense of this place is, Christ was made a <hi>Sacrifice for sinne,</hi> yet this doth not exclude, but necessarily include, that our sinnes were imputed to him; and indeed, How could it come about, that Christ should be thus bruised and wounded, that he should die such an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death? but because sinne was laid to his charge, <hi>for death is the wages of sinne;</hi> seeing therefore he had none of his own, they must be ours; not that therefore Christ was to be denominated a sinner, because he took them upon him, to bear them away.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Christs righteousnesse is made ours, because in him <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>4</label>
                        <pb n="300" facs="tcp:118921:167"/> only we are accepted.</hi> Notably to this doth the Apostle speak, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Wherein he hath made us accepted in his beloved,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; So that it is neither our persons, or our duties absolutely as so, can have any acceptance any further then God looketh upon them through Christ; He is the Altar that sanctifieth all, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.3. This is the Incense upon the golden Altar, which was to be added to the prayers of all the Saints. Its therefore very much derogatory to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fulnesse of Christ, to think that he hath only merited and purchased grace for us, in which, and by which we are to stand justified. No, the very satisfaction and obedience of Christ, must be made ours; We must be looked upon, as if we had done it in our persons. A beleever and Christ is to be considered as one mystical person, when God looketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us and Christ, as two in this sense, then woe be unto us. All the grace and favour we have is in the beloved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>5</label> Fifthly, <hi>The righteousnesse we have to be justified by, is often called the righteousnesse of God; Therefore that cannot be any other wayes in us, but by imputation.</hi> Its often called the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of God,</hi> Rom. 1.17. Rom. 10.3. 2 Cor. 5.21. Phil. 3.6. Here we are to have the righteousnesse of God, and it is opposed to our own righteousnesse; yea we are said to be made this righteousnesse of God. Its true, in what sense it is called the righteousnesse of God, may be controverted, and it is agreed upon by all hands (except <hi>Osiander,</hi> who had few followers, and his opinion lasted but two years, though <hi>Andreas Osiander</hi> doth labour to excuse him, and saith, the Orthodox kept communion with him, as if his errours were more in his words, then in his minde) that it is not the essential righteousnesse of God, whereby he is just in himself. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it the righteousnesse of God in a causal sense meerly, because God is the Authour of it, for our inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is wrought by God, yet it cannot be called the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of God in this sense, because its said to be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, and we are said to be <hi>the righteousnesse of God in Christ,</hi> therefore not in our selves: its alwayes opposed to the righteousnesse of the Law, which righteousnesse is of God in this sense, that he was the authour of it in <hi>Adam,</hi>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:118921:167"/> and doth still begin it in beleevers, and will consummate it in heaven; therefore its called the righteousnesse of God, partly, because it is that, which he doth approve of, which can endure his sight; for whereas the Scripture saith, <hi>In Gods sight no man can be justified;</hi> implying thereby, that before man they may; Therefore this righteousnesse of God is such as may be brought before his severe Tribunal, such as God himself cannot refuse as imperfect and insufficient: But espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially its called the righteousnesse of God, because it was the righteousnesse of him who was God as well as man; and therefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. he is said <hi>to be made of God righteousnesse, &amp;c.</hi> Neither can this Text be so slightly passed over, as some would; That as Christ is said to be <hi>wisdome,</hi> because he is the authour of it, so of righteousnesse, because he works inherent righteousnesse in us, for this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in that expression, when Christ is said to be made <hi>sanctification to us;</hi> Therefore righteousnesse is here taken for another thing then inward holinesse, and if so, it can be no otherwise then thus, Christ is made to us righteousnesse, because in and through him we are accounted righteous. Now this is so clear, that in the point of Satisfaction, all our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries (except <hi>Socinians</hi> agree) for there we are righteous as to the Law of God, not in our selves, for we were not able to discharge the penalty, but in another, who was Christ our Surety. The righteousnesse then of God is in the same sense used, as the bloud of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the righteousnesse of him who was God and man, and so becoming our full and compleat Mediatour, brought such a righteousnesse as was not in the world before: for <hi>Adams</hi> righteousnesse and the Angels righteousnesse, cannot be called the righteousnesse of God, as Christs is: if then it be the righteousnesse of God, it cannot be ours by infusion or acquisition.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly and lastly, <hi>Our righteousnesse must be imputed by <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>6</label> which we are justified, because that which is inherent in us, is imperfect, subject to much drosse and pollution, and therefore doth provoke and offend God, if strictly and severely examined.</hi> It is true, we have an inward righteousnesse which may be called so truly and properly, yea in some sense perfect, but
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:118921:168"/> never so perfect as to be the matter of our Justification, to be that which we may rest upon before God; if therefore our own inherent will not serve, an imputed one must be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.</p>
                  <p>But I shall no longer be on the affirmative part, because in the Discourse of Christs active obedience many of these things must be reassumed: I shall therefore proceed to answer such Objections as are brought against imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and its good to take notice of this, That the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> they oppose all imputed righteousnesse, whether it be by Satisfaction or Obedience to the Law; so that this use we may make of it, That there is not scarce any one Argument brought by Authours against the imputed active obedience of Christ, but the same is urged against the imputed passive obedience of Christ; and when we come to that subject, shall give you the parallesme of the Arguments which are against imputed passive, and imputed active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> For the present, That which is from Scripture most oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against this truth, is, those several places of Scripture (and they are almost innumerable, that I need not mention them) wherein beleevers are called <hi>righteous,</hi> and God is said <hi>to approve of them, and to give them eternal glory in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their righteousnesse, all which looketh as if God did regard inherency and not imputation.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </label> But to such places as these are, there is a free and ready concession, That all justified persons are renewed, are made righteous, walk in the wayes of righteousnesse, give up themselves as servants to righteousnesse, and that God makes glorious promises both of this life, and the life to come to that godlines and righteousnes which they abound in: But what then? Is it therefore the matter for which they stand justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God? Doth this righteousnesse answer the Law of God. Thus both Scripture and experience is against it. Consider <hi>Job</hi> excellently clearing this, <hi>Job</hi> 9.2, 3. <hi>How should man be just before God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand;</hi> and truly for a man to think otherwise, or to bear up himself against God, is called har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:118921:168"/> and such an one shall not prosper: And <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Though I were righteous (i. e.</hi> though I know nothing by my self) <hi>yet I would not answer, but make supplication,</hi> and the reason of this is laid down <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>For reasons which they bring, they are like the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> they have a specious colour, but when touched are nothing but dust. And truly it may be great grief of heart, that whereas formerly imputed righteousnesse was oppugned only by the professed Adversaries of the Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; Now from our own selves arise men that with great fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse oppose it. What uncivil passion doth a late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shew against this Doctrine of imputed righteousnesse? calling it to him an <hi>unintelligible notion, empty</hi> and <hi>truthlesse words and fancies (Justification Justified, pag.</hi> 20.) Surely its very uncharitable to make such a number of learned men, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the Church, in all their books to have written, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty and truthlesse words, and to have delivered unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible fancies. But let us see where his strength lieth. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the righteousnesse of Christ be made formally ours, then we are as perfect as Christ, need no more faith or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance then Christ. To this effect also the great Papists, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others, especially <hi>Sanders,</hi> is large upon this, that then we should be made equal with Christ. But doth not the weakest and most distempered eye see the feeblenesse of this consequence? For the righteousnesse of Christ is not received by us, as if it were <hi>subjectively inherent in us,</hi> as if there were such a communication of Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse to us, as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> say, There is of the divine Attributes to the humane nature, to make it infinite, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it is imputed to us, so farre as we needed it. Its not made ours in the infinity of it, or the extension of it, but according to our necessity; so that we cannot be said to be as righteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:118921:169"/> from the Sunne? But because the <hi>Antinomian</hi> doth affirm this as a truth naturally deducted from the Doctrine of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteousnesse; and because the Adversaries also fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten this upon the Orthodox, as an unavoidable consequence, I shall answer it more largely when we come to assert Christs active obedience imputed to us.</p>

For</hi> (say they) <hi>by imputed righteousnesse we should be pronounced just, and accounted as righteous, when yet we are in our selves imperfect; and that God should at the same time look upon us, and account us to be both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and imperfect, is that which is exceedingly wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at.</hi>

For how can we at the same time be looked upon by God, as having the debt paid in our Surety, and yet in our selves guilty? How at the same time doth God blot out our sinnes, and yet sin remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it be impossible to be accounted imperfect in Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and yet perfect in Justification, then one of these absurdities must necessarily be maintained, either that our Justification is imperfect, and if so, then we can have but imperfect peace and joy, seeing our pardon and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is imperfect, or else our sanctification is perfect, which yet is expresly denied by that Author of the Sermon, <hi>pag.</hi> 17. Its therefore necessary that God should look upon our san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification as imperfect, though our Justification be perfect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Gods judgement is according to righteousnesse and truth, we be pronounced righteous in Christ, though sinners in our selves, for there is a righteousnesse whereby we are made righteous, and this righteousnesse is by God made ours, we being in the number of those whom Christ undertook to be made a Surety for; So that we are not to account this imputation a meer bare thought in God without any founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:118921:169"/> of truth, for as truly and as really as Christ died, and rose again; so reall are the benefits which a believer partaketh of by him. Therefore imputation is grounded upon the sure performance of that which Christ undertook for us, and if a <hi>tittle of the Law shall not fall to the ground,</hi> much lesse shall any of those benefits he hath purchased. Now there cannot be imagined any way how Christs benefits should be derived to us, but by imputation.</p>

                  <p>THis Evangelical Prophet doth in this Chapter not so much foretell a Prophesie, as punctually describe an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Christs sufferings. As for the <hi>Jews</hi> interpretation of this concerning the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> or <hi>Grotius</hi> his applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> though more sublimely, to Christ, they are with neglect to be passed by: for <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.32. do evidently demonstrate this Chapter to be wholly a clear Prophesie or rather History of Christ; in so much that our Prophet is like the morning starre dispelling the dark sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of <hi>Moses,</hi> and shewing Christ, the rising Sun.</p>
                  <p>In the words you may consider, 1. <hi>The corrective</hi> or <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versative particle, But:</hi> this is spoken in opposition to those thoughts which the <hi>Jews</hi> had concerning Christ, for they judged him to be so smitten of God, and put to death in that extraordinary shamefull manner, because God hated him, as if he had been some egregious impostor, and transcendent wicked man: Now saith the Prophet, But it was not so,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:118921:170"/> whatsoever men thought, <hi>he was thus wounded for our sinnes and iniquities.</hi> So that in the words we may consider what is derived from us to Christ, and from Christ to us, or the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ablatum</hi> and the <hi>bonum collatum.</hi> In the evil removed, we may consider the <hi>person</hi> suffering, the <hi>manner</hi> how, and the <hi>impulsive cause:</hi> The <hi>person</hi> is Christ, as abundantly appears by the foresaid allegations, who was God and man, and so onely could procure our redemption for us. The <hi>manner</hi> of suffering is expressed in those words, <hi>he was wounded,</hi> and <hi>he was bruised.</hi> This signifieth his death to be most sharp and bitter, wherein all his bones were as it were to be contunded into dust. 2. <hi>The impulsive cause</hi> is said to be for our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions. The Hebrew word signifieth the proud and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious transgressions of Gods commands: and for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that signifieth all sinne, any thing that is a perverse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination from the right way. Its not worth the while to confute the <hi>Socinian</hi> cavil, that would not have the preposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Min,</hi> to signifie a cause, but a remote occasion. In the good bestowed or procured, there we may consider, the <hi>mercy or benefit it self,</hi> our peace; that is either generally all good and happiness, as commonly the word signifieth, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly peace with God, and in our own conscience. 2. The <hi>cause of this,</hi> the chastisement was upon him: The word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth correction or discipline, it comes from a word that signifieth to learn, but because the dull scholar needeth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, therefore its applied to chastisements; and here in reference to Christ, it signifieth all that misery and calamity he underwent for our sakes. It followeth, <hi>with his stripes we are healed:</hi> This is to be understood spiritually, in respect of our guilt, so that the very reading of this text should kindle the fire of love in our hearts to Christ, for bow dear did it cost him to bring about peace for us; our sinnes wounded him, our sinnes buffeted him, our sinnes crucified him: That as Naturalists speak of a bird, which applied to a man sick of the Jaundies, takes the disease to her self, and becomes all over that colour, and so dieth to heal the man; Thus in some respect, Christ took our sinnes upon him, he was crucified and died as a sinner, when yet no guile was found in his mouth.
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:118921:171"/> Thus we have a wonderfull exchange, God became man, wisedom was made folly, righteousness was made sinne, and life became death. Having therefore shewed that <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness we stand justified by before God, is an imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and that of Christs,</hi> let us first consider the <hi>satisfactory righteousness which is made ours,</hi> and this is very clearly and emphatically described all along the Chapter, so that we may call it a spiritual crucifix wherein the Lord Christ is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set forth crucified before our eies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> That the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us for our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note>
                     <hi>That the sufferings of Christ are imputed to us for our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> This is genuinely deduced from the text, for <hi>our iniquities are laid upon him, he was bruised for our iniquities,</hi> and we were <hi>healed</hi> and reconciled to God by this means. The sufferings of Christ as satisfying Gods justice for our sinnes, are our legal righteousness, its as if we our selves in our own persons had made a compensation.</p>
                  <p>To open this, let us take notice of all the other emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call expressions that are used by the Prophet in this Chapter, for we are not only speculatively, but affectionately and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to meditate on them; and the Prophet doth so often mention it, as if he in the Old Testament, like <hi>Paul</hi> in the New, desired to know nothing but Christ crucified. At <hi>v.</hi> 6. we have a notable phrase, <hi>The Lord hath made the iniquity of us all to meet on him;</hi> where you see, 1. its Gods act, that all our sinnes should be laid on him, here is nothing done against Gods will. 2. Its the iniquity of us all, all the sinnes of the elect people of God, let them be great sinnes or smal, there is not one but it is laid on Christ. And then 3. They are made to meet on him; the word is taken from many streams of water, that violently meet in one place, and so will bear down every thing before them; thus all our sinnes in the guilt of them, were made to meet on Christ, that had he been meer man, they would have overwhelmed him over and over again, but being God as well as man, he could with <hi>Sampson</hi> rise up and break these cords. Thus you see the sharpest stings that all our sinnes could put forth, were run into him, but by this he overcame sinne. At the fourth verse, there is likewise a pregnant expression, <hi>Surely
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:118921:171"/> he hath born our griefs and carried our sorrows.</hi> By griefs and sorrows are meant sinne with all the consequents of it, and the two Hebrew words <hi>Nasa</hi> and especially <hi>Saball</hi> signifie to lift up a thing, to bear, to indure and carry a thing upon the shoulder as Porters do, and by consequent to take it quite away. This place is alledged, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.15. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. but the application of it by the Evangelist <hi>Matthew,</hi> to the healing of diseases hath caused a twofold difficulty; 1. As if the Prophet spake only of bodily diseases and infirmities. 2. As if the bearing of them was not by imputation, for our diseases were not imputed to him, but only by removing and taking away; but seeing the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> doth apply it to sinnes, and the Evangelist to bodily diseases, we may say, that the Prophet speaks principally and most directly of sinne, but secondarily and less principally of bodily diseases, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the effect and fruit of sinne, so that we may say in some sense, He took all our bodily infirmities upon him, because he took our sinnes upon him; and howsoever the Learned observe that the Hebrew word <hi>Nasa</hi> may signifie the ablation of a thing, which yet is not derived or imputed to him, as God himself is said to take away sinne, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. yet no place can be or is brought, no not by the Socinians, though so diligent to search in this matter, where <hi>Saball</hi> doth signifie to take away, but alwaies is used to bear and to carry. So that this later word doth necessarily imply a derivation and imputation of our sinnes upon him; they lay as an heavy burden upon him: <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. Christ is said <hi>to bear up,</hi> or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all things, but that is done easily by his power, there is no difficulty in it; only to bear sinne, that was so great a weight and burden, that with great agonies and conflicts, he labours with it; he bore that burden which sinketh all the devils and damned men into hell. No less considerable is <hi>vers.</hi> 10. <hi>It pleased the Lord to bruise him, he hath put him to grief:</hi> This relates not only to death, but to all those anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and troubles which he indured in his soul: and it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, how the Scripture doth not referre this meerly to Gods permission, as if he suffered wicked men to procure his death, but here is an higher design and purpose of God;
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:118921:172"/> therefore in the Hebrew it's <hi>Chaphits,</hi> which signifieth Gods good pleasure, his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, wherein he taketh great delight: so that whereas we might be offended to think that Gods Sonne, innocent and free from all iniquity, should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to so much misery and violence, this may satisfie us, that it was the just and righteous will of God, wherein his good pleasure did shew it self, for hereby he would create for himself the greatest glory that could be: further more, whereas this death of Christ might be accounted only a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Martyrdom or a transcendent example of patience, as the Socinians cavil; We have the nature of his death descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the word <hi>Asham,</hi> which word in its first and proper signification doth denote to sinne and offend, and by a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymy</hi> is used for a sacrifice, whereby the sinne of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor is expiated, as <hi>piaculum</hi> among the Latins: So that we are to look on Christs death, as that which is propitiatory, and expiatory of all that guilt which belongs to us. We may not pass by <hi>ver.</hi> 11. where the work of our redemption is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the travell of his soul,</hi> which cannot but denote the great misery and affliction he indured to purchase our peace. It was said to the woman, that <hi>in sorrow she should bring forth,</hi> and thus it was also in Christ, it behoved him in great grief and trouble both of soul and body, to bring forth this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous salvation, which is to be bestowed on those that are his; and whereas it is said, that <hi>by the knowledge, i. e.</hi> by the faith of Christ <hi>many shall be justified,</hi> observe the reason given, <hi>for he shall bear their iniquities.</hi> This makes it plain that we are justified or constituted and pronounced righteous, because Christ did bear our sinnes. The last verse is considerable, where the willingness and readiness of Christ is described, <hi>He hath poured out his soul unto death.</hi> This denoteth how freely and gladly he offered up himself, though the bruising and wounding was so great, though his calamities were thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible, yet he poureth out his soul. Oh what a shame and trembling should this be to us, who finde our hearts so dead and dull, so listless many times to that which is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Shall Christ pour out his soul to death, and shalt not thou pour it out to praier and to love Christ? Yea this death
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:118921:172"/> is called <hi>v.g.</hi> deaths in the plural number, to aggravate it, as if it were many deaths he died, even as many as there are elect people, who without this redeemer were to die in their own person.<note place="margin">Conclusions from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note> The summe of these glorious and full texts concerning Christs sufferings ariseth to these particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That Christ suffered in a most painfull and grievous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> The Schoolmen determine that Christ indured more grief, then all the sorrows of all the men in the world put <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> together: this is certain the Scripture by these several ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions doth evidence, that his pain and sorrow was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable: and if we reade the Evangelists describing what affections were upon him both before and at his sufferings, we shall readily yield they were no less, then what were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That these sorrows and afflictions were in his soul as well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as in his body:</hi> For its impossible that the body of a man should be pained and afflicted, but the soul must also be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of it, because of the near conjunction of soul and body. Therefore in all sorrow and grief, the soul is the principal, the body instrumental; that as the soul seeth by the eye, heareth by the ear, so it is grieved and pained by the body, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> well, <hi>In carne, &amp; cum carne, &amp; per carnem agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ab animâ, quod agitur in corde.</hi> Christ then could not suffer in his body, but he must necessarily suffer in his soul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This suffering in his soul, was not only that which arose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from conjunction with his body, but also more immediatly from the apprehension of Gods displeasure for our sinnes, in whose room be stood.</hi> This indeed is denied, and so a great part of Christs passive righteousness imputed to us is destroyed; but as is to be shewed, Christ died not a meer simple death, as Martyrs, or as ordinary men, but as a surety, as a curse for us, and as satisfying the justice of God, and therefore there were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate sufferings in his soul, though without sinne: hence we reade of those great agonies and troubles that were in his minde, before he had pain in his body any way.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Hence Christs death is to be looked upon as a peculiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> thing;</hi> that as there is no person ever was like
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:118921:173"/> him, <hi>God and man,</hi> so no death like his, being an atonement to God, to satisfie his justice, to reconcile God. This sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory efficacy in Christs death, we have at large shewed already.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Therefore in the fifth place, <hi>It is from this compensatory virtue in Christs death, that he is made our righteousness.</hi> That whereas God was offended, death was deserved; and we wholly impossible to pacifie God, he became our Mediator and surety, making this blessed and happy exchange that our sinnes should be laid on him, and his righteousness commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to us: and in this sense all Papists will yield, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Now to this satisfactory righteousness of Christ, by way of imputation, there are two arguments brought, which were not treated of before, at least the first.</p>

                     </label> But in the first place, seeing that it must needs be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that Christ died such a shamefull and painfull death as he did, and further that he was innocent, so that no guile was found in his mouth; yea <hi>Pilate</hi> his judge acquitted him: it must therefore follow that an innocent man was put to death; he that died had no cause of death, no not in any way: So that Christs sufferings were not like <hi>Jobs,</hi> whom God did by his soveraign power afflict by way of trial, for though this was not done for any particular sinne of <hi>Jobs,</hi> yet he was not without sinne: Though <hi>Job</hi> was not thus chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>propter peccatum,</hi> yet it was not <hi>sine peccato:</hi> But in Christ
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:118921:173"/> all his sufferings were, if we respect his own person, causeless, he had no sinne for which any of those calamities could be brought upon him, therefore it must be for our sinnes: and hence the Socinians themselves are forced to acknowledge, that though Christ did not suffer for our sinnes as the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive or meritorious cause, yet he did for them as the occasion, because by his death he left us an example, and withall recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved power to do away our sinnes, if no more be granted but this, it will necessarily follow that an innocent person did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for a nocent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It is so farre from being repugnant to Gods goodness, that the Scripture aggravateth this consideration, that whereas he himself was without sinne, yet he would undertake the punishment of sinners,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21. 1 Pet. 3.18. <hi>Christ once suffered for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the just for the unjust:</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He who knew no sinne, became sinne for us:</hi> So that if Christ had not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, it would have been wholly impossible for him to have wrought our redemption, and herein the Scripture preferreth Christ before the legal high Priest, that he was to offer <hi>for his own sinnes,</hi> as well as of the people; but Christ was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted and altogether holy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which may wholly satisfie this objection, is, <hi>That it is no injustice or cruelty for an innocent person to suffer for a nocent, as Christ did, provided there be these conditions:</hi> 1. That the person suffering be of the same nature and kinde with those for whom he suffers, for seeing that it was man whom God had threatned, its necessary it should be one of mankinde that must suffer: Not an Angel, if it had been possible for him to be our Mediatour. 2. Its no injustice, if the innocent person be <hi>willing,</hi> if this be not laid upon him contrary to his desire; but we see in Christ an earnest readiness of heart to undertake all our grief, he desireth it as the greatest good that could befall him: Hence its said, <hi>He poured out his soul an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for sinne;</hi> so that as sometimes the Scripture speaks of God designing and appointing him thereunto, so at other times it saith, <hi>He gave himself a ransom for our sinnes:</hi> and <hi>Behold I come to do thy will O God,</hi> yea he was streightened till he did it. Thus you see this was not against his will,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:118921:174"/> yea it was that which he greatly desired.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>It is no cruelty, if the innocent party be able to bear and indure all that sorrow which shall be laid upon him.</hi> Indeed to lay an heavy load upon such weak shoulders as will break un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden, is unmercifulness: but Christ was able to go through all. Though he was in agonies, yet he cried <hi>My God;</hi> and though he was dead and buried, yet even from thence by his own power he could raise himself.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Its no injustice, If by the sufferings of an innocent person there can be wrought a greater good, and more glory to God, then his meer suffering is an evil:</hi> But thus it is here, by Christs dying for the ungodly, the greatest glory and honour is brought to God, that ever was or can be; insomuch that God himself could not demonstrate a greater effect of his love, nor could there be a more open way to advance his glory. Therefore in some sense we may say, the affliction and death it self was justly laid upon Christ, not in respect of men, for they did it wickedly, and maliciously, so that there was no humane reason or law to put him to death; but if we do regard Gods will, and the Covenant made between the Father and the Son, then it was just, that if Christ would be a Surety for sinners, and satisfie what Gods justice and the Law did require, that he must die such a death as was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to sinne.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> The second Argument hath greater difficulty in it, and many other inferiour difficulties are contained in it: <hi>If Christs sufferings by way of satisfaction be our imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, then he must suffer all that we were doomd unto;</hi> for by what reason he was bound to die, which was one part of the curse threatned, by the same reason he was bound to suffer all the other parts of the curse denounced: Now the other parts were chiefly <hi>a spiritual and an eternal death, which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not applicable to Christ without blasphemy:</hi> so that its very difficult to decide what sufferings they are which Christ sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied God with, and are made our righteousness. As for the Socinians they take away the foundation of the question, so that we are not to ingage with them: But even amongst those that hold Christs satisfaction by his sufferings, there
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:118921:174"/> are different opinions: That which is weakest and most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd of all is, of those that hold <hi>his sufferings onely spiritual;</hi> that what he indured as our Surety for us, it was only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and trouble in his soul: but this doth so directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front Scripture, that it may be wondered how any can have such a thought, seeing every where almost his death is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced in as a ransom and sacrifice for our sinnes. Neither is the argument of any validity which they bring, <hi>That if Christ satisfied by his death, then we could not die, or if we did die, then we should be copartners with him in his work of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</hi> But this may be retorted on themselves, who hold Christ satisfaction only in his soul: <hi>for, do not many of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God feel the terrours of God upon their souls?</hi> do not they often conflict with Gods anger, though Christ felt these up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his soul? and are the godly when they feel this, copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with Christ in the work of our redemption? The godly therefore though they die, yet it is not to the same end and purpose which Christ did, for they die not to satisfie Gods wrath, or to appease his justice, but their death is made a blessing unto them, and a sure passage to eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>Therefore dismissing these, there are a numerous part rise up, that hold <hi>Christs sufferings by way of satisfaction was onely in his body.</hi> Indeed they will grant Christ suffered in his soul, by <hi>sympathy</hi> or conjunction from the body, for its impossible if a man be living and sensible, but that when the body suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, the soul also should suffer therewith. But this they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily deny, that Christ suffered in his soul relatively to our sinne, as if he apprehended the wrath of God due to our iniquities, so as to tremble and to be in those grievous ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies because of such an apprehension. The Papists they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally go this way, limiting his sufferings to his body. In for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times amongst the Orthodox this was controverted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, as appeareth by Bishop <hi>Bilsons</hi> book on this subject, who is also industriously for the negative, that Christ suffered not in his soul in the sense specified; And now very lately this opinion is revived, that Christs body offered on the Cross was the satisfactory oblation, and that he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not in his soul in the mentioned sense. There is a book
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:118921:175"/> whose scope is to assert this, and overthrow the contrary, [<hi>Pinchin</hi> of the meritorious price of mans Redemption, and a Sermon lately printed to justifie that opinion.] But it may be made good by Scripture, <hi>That the sufferings of Christ, wherein satisfaction to Gods justice doth consist, and which are our righteousnesse, are both of soul and body:</hi> So that Christ while he made an atonement for our sins, was not only brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and crucified in his body, but in his soul also was without the sense of that joy and comfort, which otherwise he had, and that because of our sinnes laid on him, though all this was without the least sin in him.</p>

                  <p>OUr work is to answer that great and weighty Objection concerning the manner of Christs sufferings: <hi>For if Christs sufferings were a legal righteousnesse, and he was bound to undergo the punishment that was due to us, then</hi> (saith the Opponent) <hi>he must suffer the pains of the damned, then he must

                  </p>
                  <p>We have declared the different opinions of learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours in this matter; That which was concluded on as the truth, was, That the whole manhood of Christ suffered in body and soul, and in his soul not meerly by conjunction or sympathy with his body, or because of a natural death meerly, but chiefly because of the anger of God due to sinners, whose person he sustained. And before I bring the Arguments for to prove this, I shall lay down several Propositions to state the Question, and to clear the truth, by which all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Objections may be answered: So that I shall not in a formal manner mention them, because I intend not to be long on this point.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Concerning the sufferings of Christ, men have been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> very prone to runne into several errours.</hi> The <hi>Arians</hi> of old they argued against the Deity of Christ, because he thus suffered. <hi>How could God</hi> (say they) <hi>be sorrowfull and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? How could Christ be God, and yet complain God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken him?</hi> Some of the Ancients answering this Argument, and thinking it indecent and unseemly for Christ to be thus troubled, did say, <hi>That Christ did not suffer these things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to himself, but for us; he did not grieve for himself, but for us,</hi> as if these affections in Christ were not so much in his own person, as our person; but this is to overthrow the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scripture; for as he was indeed man, so he was indeed sorrowfull and grieved: As he was really crucified, so was he also in Agonies, crying out, <hi>My God, Why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Thus these give too little: Others they have gone too farre, making the very Divine Nature it self to suffer, but that is impossible. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Maldonat</hi> cry out, <hi>That we should shut our ears against the blasphemy of Calvinists in this particular, who say, Christ suffered the pains of the damned in his soul, and that this was his descending into hell.</hi> But if <hi>Maldonat</hi> had remembred his own Rule, when he expounds those words of Christ <hi>[My God, Why hast thou forsaken me?]</hi> he would not have been so censorious. [<hi>Com. in Mat.</hi> 26.] He alledgeth very hard speeches of some of the Fathers, which if rigidly examined would be intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:118921:176"/> doctrine, and yet he can say, <hi>Bonos Autores benignè inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretari decet.</hi> But for <hi>Calvin,</hi> he doth not onely wrest, but falsifie his words: For whereas <hi>Calvin</hi> is brought to say, That <hi>vox desperationis</hi> did <hi>elabi</hi> from Christ, This is a calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for that is brought in by way of an Objection, its not <hi>Calvins</hi> assertion; and besides <hi>[Harmon. Evangel. in cap.</hi> 26. <hi>Matth.] Vox desperationis</hi> is not <hi>desperatio,</hi> he doth not say, Christ despaired, yea its his whole drift in that place to free Christ from the least sinfull perturbation; Though, he saith, they are too frigid and cold that expound Christs sufferings of his body only; This, he saith, is to make Christ a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of the body onely, and not of the soul. Its true, there are some expressions in <hi>Calvin</hi> that happily may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious, and obnoxious to cavil, as when he saith, that prayer of Christ <hi>[If it be possible, let this Cup passe away]</hi> was not <hi>meditata,</hi> and that it came from him <hi>subitò,</hi> which he corrected; for though these are well excused by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, yet malicious enemies think they have thereby cause to triumph. But no man that reads <hi>Calvin</hi> can acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any other but an admirable dexterity in interpreting of Scripture, which made <hi>Stapleton</hi> himself call him, <hi>Suavissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Scripturae interpres;</hi> and truly in his Exposition of those Texts, which describe Christs sufferings, he doth excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew, That those great fears and troubles which Christ felt, must needs be more then from the apprehension of meer death, even a conflict with the anger of God, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof. Therefore though he saith, Christ did <hi>luctari cum desperatione,</hi> yet for all that he overcame all those tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As for the opinion of those who say, Christ suffered the pains of the damned; and if Bishop <hi>Bilsons</hi> Refuter said, <hi>That Christ suffered as much terrour in his soul as any reprobate could,</hi> These passages are again corrected by those Authors, For they say, <hi>That they acknowledge Christ was all this while free from sin, and that there was not the least blemish in his pure and unspotted soul.</hi> But to avoid all calumnies, its best to keep our selves to the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Onely in the second place, Take notice of this, <hi>That the lower Christ is debased in working out our salvation, the more is
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:118921:176"/> he honoured and glorified.</hi> Any kinde of debasement that the Scripture giveth to Christ, and that in general words, we are to expound as largely as they signifie, so that we do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute sin to him. As when the Prophet saith, <hi>He was brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and wounded for our iniquities, God laid all our sinnes upon him,</hi> We are to interpret this of his soul as well as his body, for seeing the Scripture speaketh it generally, we are so to expound it; Therefore seeing the scope of the Scripture is to amplifie and aggravate the sorrows of Christ, we are to enlarge them as farre as may be, so that thereby we involve him in no sin; Therefore that fear of some, to say, Christ was truly troubled, that he was indeed in such agonies; and so of others, that will admit of no agonies and conflicts in the soul, with Gods wrath for our sinnes, is a dishonouring of Christ, while they think to honour him; for as it would be a dishonour to say, he was not man, he was not in a state of humiliation, he was not crucified; so likewise that he was not grievously tempted in his soul, though without sin. <hi>Ambrose</hi> spake better, <hi>Confidenter tristitiam nomino, quia cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem praedico.</hi> And again, <hi>Non crubesco fateri, quod Christus magna voce non erubescit profiteri.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>In this Doctrine of Christs suffering the wrath of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God for our sinnes, we are not to measure Christ after our own selves, who cannot have any struglings and agonies of soul with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some sinne adhering.</hi> Grant that Christ did onely fear death, yet no man could fear it so, but that some imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or irregularity would cleave to it. Now in all those troubles Christ felt in his soul, there was a two-fold difference to be made between him and a meer man. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whatsoever fears and agonies were in Christ, they were voluntary, he had a command over them, both in respect of their rise, their progresse and duration; so that it was not with him as with us, who are carried captive and overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med whether we will or no, by those passions that move us, <hi>John</hi> 11.33. its said Christ <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we translate it, <hi>He was troubled,</hi> but in the Original it is, <hi>He troubled himself.</hi> Thus all the afflictions and grief of soul, which were upon
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:118921:177"/> him were voluntary, he had a power to command these winds and waves to be still when he pleased. Even as he had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over his life to lay it down, and take it up, so of his grief and temptations, so that because they were under his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary government and disposing, there could be no sinne in them. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith well, He took these troubles not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionis necessitate,</hi> but <hi>miserationis voluntate,</hi> not by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition necessitating him thereunto, but a willing and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condescension.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another difference is in respect of the original from whence these affections flow, for they came from Christs pure, holy and undefiled nature: So that whatsoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion and troubles might be in Christs soul, yet they were alwayes holy, for from such a pure fountain could come no other but pure streams: Even as water in a pure glasse, though ye shake it never so much, yet it is pure and clear. But now man being originally corrupted, and so having some mud and filth in the bottome of his soul, he is never shaken and moved, but some impurity and defilement will rise up; Do not then judge of Christ according to what we finde in our selves? Certainly we could not endure such agonies, we could not have said, <hi>My God, Why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> But there would have been some gradual diffidence, some sinful impatience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>That which was the greatest and most eminent in Christs soul, while he suffered, was not the fear of death, but a want of that joy and comfort, or the sense and feeling of Gods favour and help.</hi> This was the sting in his sufferings, as we shall prove anon. I am now onely to explain it, because the Adversaries will not understand the sense of the Orthodox, but take up the words of hell, and the torments of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and a second death; as if hereby all blasphemy were uttered against Christ; but we say, That Christs sufferings, and those extream agonies in his soul did arise from a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cause then meer death, it was because of our sinnes laid upon him; and so as in our stead did undergo our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so farre as it implied no sinne, and this was for a season to be destitute of all inward comfort, to want those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:118921:177"/> apprehensions of Gods favour and protection, which the Divine Nature did for a while deny, that so in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature he might go through the work of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. To open this, you must know, That though Christ was God and man, yet the Divine Nature did not alwayes put forth such glorious and resplendent effects, as it could do, but did as it pleased cohibit and restrain them, otherwise Christ could not have been in a state of humiliation and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for us; We reade <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.2. <hi>That Christ was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, his face did shine as the Sunne, and his raiment was white as light.</hi> What was this but the Divine Nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating and diffusing such glory to the manhood? and had it not been for that oeconomy or dispensation, that Christ must be in a despised, servile and ignominious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he would have been alwayes in such glory. Therefore that was not a miracle, for Christ to be so transfigured, his humiliation and debasement was a miracle, for thereby was suspended that glory and lustre, which according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural course, would have been derived from the Godhead to his humane Nature. Therefore its no more contradiction for Christ at the same time to have faith in God, and yet to want the sense of comfort, then to know God was his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that would support him, and deliver him, yet to be in such extream fears and agonies, as they confesse he was in, because of his death: So that by what means they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile these two together, so can we his faith in God, and yet want of the sense of Gods favour in these temptations; And whereas it might be said, That the want of Gods favour is a sinne; that is wholly denied, for the meer want of the sense of Gods love is not intrinsecally a sinne: Even in the people of God, meer and simple absence, or want of the favour of God, by some desertions which they are in, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for trial and exploration, is not a sinne. Indeed a godly man can very difficultly be in a spiritual temptation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining God hath left him, but there is sinne accompanying such a complaint, because we for the most part procure such spiritual desertions by our own fault, and being weak in faith do many times offend against the promises of God, but it
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:118921:178"/> was not thus in Christ. Its true, as every thing almost in Christ was a miracle, that he was God and man, that he should be born in such an extraordinary manner, so likewise that he should suffer in such a transcendent way. This Sunne of righteousnesse suffered an Eclip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> by the interposition of our sins, and though he was sensible of, and strugled with the anger of God due to us, in whose stead he appeared, yet in all this he was not overcome, or did he give place to any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation for a moment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, <hi>Though this spiritual dereliction be not to be limited to an external forsaking and leaving of him into the hand of the Jews, yet we are not to enlarge it unto every kinde of forsaking, as if Christ were forsaken of God in every respect, as the damned in hell are, but only so farre that way might be given for Christ in soul and body, to accomplish our redemption by his sufferings.</hi> For as Christ would not call for a Legion of Angels exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to protect him in his neccessity; so neither would he have at that time those inward joyes and comfortable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, that so he might drink of that bitter cup which was prepared for him, because of our sins: Christ could not have been in those natural fears and afflictions, had not the Divine Nature given place; So neither in this spiritual desertion; <hi>But this desertion was not universal, and in every respect.</hi> For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There was not a dissolution of the hypostatical Union, no not in death it self; for although the soul was separated from the body, yet the Divinity all that while was neither divided from soul or body, he did not then cease to be God, though in such an abysse of grief. Nor</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Was it a dereliction in respect of graces, as if God did so leave his humane Nature, that it was deprived thereby of faith and hope, or love of God: how low so ever he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based, yet still the Scripture saith, his temptations were without sinne in him; and this all those Divines do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that yet use these expressions, That his soul suffered death, and that he endured the pains of the damned: he was not then forsaken of God in respect of any gracious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:118921:178"/>3. It was not a total desertion in respect of every part; for although Christ in respect of his sense and feeling, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of this forsaking, yet in respect of his minde and will, he had confidence in God, and knew that God would carry him through that great agony he was exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was not a final dereliction; all this forsaking was but for a time, he had before and after more comfortable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions; for formerly, when he had told his Disciples, <hi>That all would forsake him, and leave him alone,</hi> he corrects that speech, <hi>I am not alone, but my Father is with me,</hi> John 16.32. This he spake before the temptation, but in the temptation he had not that comfortable sense of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, In this Controversie therefore we must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> consider <hi>Christ as sustaining two Persons, his own and ours. In his own Person he was altogether holy and innocent, free from all sinne, and most beloved of his Father, from whom no shew of anger could appear, if considered in his own Person. But then, if he be considered as bearing our person, in which respect he is called our Surety,</hi> Heb. 7.2. <hi>and our sinnes laid upon him; So he apprehended the anger of God, and was to satisfie the Justice of God, by bearing that punishment which was due to us.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Argument is very weak, which would prove Christ not to bear Gods wrath, because he was alwayes beloved of his Father: For this is true in respect of his own Person: but then as covenanting for us, so he was to conflict with Gods anger; for why was it, that though beloved of God, and most innocent, that he should suffer death, and that so pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that the Adversaries acknowledge it to be the extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est suffering that could be in a way of grief and pain? But only for our sinnes, because he stood in our stead; and as the <hi>Javelin</hi> which was runne at <hi>David</hi> missed him, and stuck fast in the wall; So the anger of God which was to have run on us with all violence, by Christs interposing of himself, passed by us, and fell on him.</p>
                  <p>These Propositions thus cleared, you may by the help of their light answer all contrary Objections; I therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:118921:179"/> by positive Arguments to confirm this truth; for its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable in regard of the practical use which may be made thereof,<note place="margin">Arguments to prove that Christ suffered the anger of God in his soul as well as in his body.</note> to know that Christ suffered in his soul, and that the anger of God, as well as in his body. And</p>
                  <p>The first <hi>Argument</hi> is founded on <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Christ hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> &amp;c.</hi> Thus we form it, <hi>The curse of the Law did reach to the terrours of the soul, as well as to the pains of the body: But Christ was made the curse of the Law for us;</hi> he doth not say, Christ was made accursed, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a curse in the abstract,</hi> to shew how greatly he was accursed in this death; Neither may you say, This execration was in respect of men, that men judged him execrable, for his enemies looked upon him as worse then <hi>Barabbas;</hi> but this curse is in respect of God, as appeareth by the testimony alledged out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.23. for though the Apostle intending the sense, and not the words, omits the mention of God; yet in the foresaid place of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy</hi> it is, <hi>He that is hanged is accursed of God.</hi> This is universally true, for though innocent and holy Martyrs have been hanged on the Tree, and so their persons were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of and beloved, yet the kinde of death was made by God amongst the Jews an accursed death, partly in a civil and political sense, such a death being inflicted onely for atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hainous sinnes; partly in a typical sense, to prefigure Christs death: So that as the lifting up of the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was a type of Christ crucified, so that kinde of death amongst the Jews in a particular manner accursed by God, called in the Hebrew <hi>The curse of God</hi> likewise in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract, was typical and prefigurative of Christs death.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, That this curse was onely in his bodily suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that manner of death.</p>
                  <p>I answer, That cannot be all, for its called <hi>the curse of the Law</hi> that Christ was made, and such as he redeemeth us from, and that is not onely of the body. And again, its such a curse that is opposed to the blessing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that was sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ritual in the soul as well as the body: So that unlesse they will say, The Law cursed the body only, they must not
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:118921:179"/> limit Christs being <hi>made a curse for us</hi> to his bodily sufferings. Indeed the Scripture doth often instance in that, excluding his sufferings of his soul, but because his bodily suffering was most visible to the eye, though in other places it speaks in the general, not naming his bloud, as when its said, <hi>It behoved Christ to suffer, and so to enter into glory,</hi> Luk. 9.22. <hi>&amp; alibi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A second <hi>Argument</hi> from the threatning, <hi>Genes.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt die.</hi> This place is brought by all the Orthodox against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> to prove the necessity of Christs death by way of an Atonement and Satisfaction to Gods justice; for seeing how God threatned upon mans sinne, that he should die, and the verity and the justice of God will not suffer this to be violated, therefore it behoved Christ to come and to be a Sacrifice for sinne. Now by death is meant not onely a meerly bodily death, but all other spiritual punishments of the soul; Therefore by what reason the justice of God did require he should suffer in his body, the same did require he should suffer in his soul; for what reason can be given, why God should release one part of the debt more then the other? If it be said, that because Christs death was the death of him who was God as well as man, it had an infinite value, and therefore the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his body were equivalent to those sufferings which we should have had in our souls.</p>
                  <p>I answer, The meer and absolute infinity of a price, is not enough to satisfie, unlesse it be commensurated to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that is adjudged by him, who is to be satisfied: for why is it that with the Papists we dare not say, one drop of Christs bloud had been enough to satisfie for us, seeing it had an infinite dignity in it, but because it was not answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods sentence which required death? So we may say, The infinite value in Christs meer bodily suffering was not enough, because the sentence required more satisfaction. But if you say, The death of the soul implieth sinne, despair, and all such impiety as cannot without blasphemy be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Christ. I answer, The punishments of sinne in the soul, are either such as are meer sinne, such as unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:118921:180"/> privation of the image of God. Or</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as are punishments and sinnes too: such are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair and blasphemy of the damned in hell, with the gnawing worm of conscience in them. And</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Such as are meerly punishments, such are the meer want of Gods favour for a time, sad conflicts and agonies arising in the soul hereupon. Now these, though in us they would necessarily produce sinne, yet in Christ they did not, because of his pure nature: Therefore though the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doth not inferre Christ should die in his soul in a sinful manner, yet as far as the threatning could be accomplished in Christs soul without sinne, it did behove him to endure, that so the justice of God may be satisfied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third <hi>Argument</hi> is taken <hi>from the relation Christ stood in, while he suffered, he died not simply in relation to his own person, he was our Surety, and he died for us in our stead;</hi> and thus the Prophet saith, <hi>All our sins were laid on him;</hi> It behoved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Surety to suffer all that we should have suffered, as farre as there was a consistency with his holy nature; And the Adversaries to Christs sufferings in his soul, do upon this Argument reject his propitiatory death, because if so (say they) he must then suffer the pains of the damned. To which the Orthodox reply, That he suffered them equivalently, his holy nature would not suffer him to receive any sinful infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, <hi>but he was tempted in all things like us, onely without sinne;</hi> compare those places, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>Heb</hi> 4.15. where Christ was to be tempted in all things like us, in spiritual tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations as well as temporal; not that he was to endure eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individual temptation in his soul, no more then every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual pain in his body, only in the general it behoved him to be thus tempted, that so he might have compassion on his members in their temptations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The last <hi>Argument</hi> is, <hi>from the remarkable description of those sufferings which were antecedent and concomitant to his death.</hi> The Evangelists expressions are so remarkable, that its a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any should think that it was only the fear of death, that should thus possesse him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. Before his death, the Evangelists record, that Christ said, <hi>His soul was heavy to death.</hi>

Adde to these <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. Neither can those of a contrary minde give a good reason, why the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs should shew such courage, and Christ manifest such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary agonies, but that our sins were laid on him, but they felt the pardon of them.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine hath a three-fold cord of practical matter, which should not be broken.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle at the close of <hi>ver.</hi> 14. doth begin an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable comparison or collation, between the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and Christ the second. It was the wicked opinion of the Manichees, that they asserted two principles, <hi>one good,</hi> the fountain of all good, the other <hi>evil,</hi> the cause of all evil: But here in a good sense we see described two different or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary originals to mankinde; the one is of <hi>sinne</hi> with all the evil consequents thereof: the other of <hi>grace,</hi> with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable effects thereof. Now <hi>Adams</hi> offence and Christs obedience are compared in their nature, their force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, and lastly their ends: But the Apostle, as he sheweth their agreement, so also he giveth their disparity and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, making the righteousness of Christ to be more abounding to Justification, then <hi>Adams</hi> sinne could be to condemnation. The Text I have pitched on, is a summary repetition of all that had been said, and a brief collection of their agreement together: In the former part you have the <gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>Apodosis</hi> is, <hi>So by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</hi>

                  <p>In the words you have the <hi>person</hi> compared, <hi>One,</hi> that is Christ: he doth not say one man, as before, though that be necessarily implied. 2. The matter in which the comparison is instituted, <hi>by one mans obedience,</hi>

Many,</hi> this is opposed to that One, by whom obedience was performed; so that the Dispute about universality of Redemption or Grace, is wholly impertinent to this Text and those preceding, for <hi>many</hi> and <hi>all</hi> are not compared in respect of mankinde, but in respect of the <hi>original</hi> or <hi>root,</hi> which is <hi>One, (shall be made righteous.)</hi> This is not to be understood of inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, but imputed; and although it be in the future tense, that doth not signifie the compleat and perfect making of us righteous in heaven, as <hi>Pareus</hi> would have, but the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual and daily efficacy of Christs obedience upon all the godly, who shall be in their successive generations to the end of the world, as <hi>Beza</hi> most solidly.</p>
                  <p>Now whether this obedience of Christ be to be limitted onely to that free and willing <hi>offering of himself to die for us,</hi> or to be taken largely for that <hi>whole course of life which was spent in obeying of the law and will of God,</hi> is disputed by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters. Those that deny the imputation of Christs active obedience, limit it only to that specificall and particular obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Christ in his death. But those of a contrary way take it largely, for <hi>all the obedience of Christ, which he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished both in doing and suffering.</hi> With these I joyn as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they have the truth of God on their side: and from what Objections they bring, I shall fully vindicate this Text,

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>Because this obedience is called,</hi> v. 18. <hi>Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> Now the sufferings of Christ are never called in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture his righteousness: They are indeed our righteousness, but not his, whereas his obedience is his own righteousness as well as ours; and indeed the very word Obedience, doth properly denote a conformity to the Law.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Because by this obedience,</hi> v. 17. <hi>we are said to have the gift <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of righteousnesse, and thereby reign in life.</hi> Now Christs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for us is but part of that righteousnesse, neither is eternall life promised meerly to a man because his sinne is pardoned, but because he hath that perfect holinesse the Law requireth, as hath been and shall be (God willing) more at large proved.</p>

Phil.</hi> 2.8.

                  <p>Having already shewed, that the sufferings of Christ are

                  <p>That Christ while on the earth, did truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly obey the will of God.</p>
                  <p>And to manifest the truth hereof, consider these ensuing Propositions.</p>
                  <p>First, It may seem very difficult to explain how it was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that Christ should in a true and formal sense be said to obey, and that from two considerations: 1. His hypostatical union; and 2. That unction of God, which he did receive. For the former, seeing his humane nature was united to the godhead in one person, so that there was but one <hi>suppositum,</hi> and that <hi>divinum,</hi> How could Christ be said to obey? for if we cannot say that God did obey, no more may we say Christ could obey, seeing he is the Person God-man: But of this more is to be said in answering the Objection, and this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion will then be discussed, <hi>Whether the hypostaticall union doth absolve Christ from any obligation to the Law:</hi> so that we may not say of him, as we do of all men, that they are bound to keep the Law of God. The second ground of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is, because of the unction Christ received, God is said to anoint him with oyl <hi>above his fellows,</hi> and he did not receive the Spirit in measure. If then his inward habitual grace was so overflowing, how could he be said to obey, because obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is properly where there is liberty? now not only the Hypostatical union, but this spiritual Unction put him into a state of <hi>impeccability:</hi> if therefore Christ could do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then he did, for who may say he might have refused to take our condition upon him, or to have forsaken our Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:118921:183"/> when he had once undertaken it, if then he could not sin, how could he be said to obey?</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Second Propos. This difficulty hath so extreamly perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some, that they have run<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">

That as it was a miracle in Christ, that though he injoyed the favour and light of Gods face beatifically, yet at the same time (which naturally is impossible) it should be so ordered by divine power, that he should have the highest degree of sorrow in his will; so its no lesse wonder, that Christ, by a faciall vision and intuitive beholding of God in a comprehensive and blessed manner, was not so determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and absolutely necessitated, but that he did obey God freely. If you ask the reason why they runne into such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, its because they receive this as an immovable axiom, standing as firm as heaven, <hi>That there cannot be any obedience, but where there is liberty, and there cannot be any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but where there is a power to do good or evil.</hi> But that which they account as a rock, is altogether sandy, for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men make it clear, that such an indifferency is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to liberty, yea <hi>posse peccare</hi> doth not arise from liberty, but mutability and vertibility; seeing therefore liberty is a perfection, we must necessarily attribute it to Christ, and it did arise from the perfection of his holiness, that he could not but obey; and whereas <hi>Adam</hi> had liberty; and therein a power to sinne, this was because <hi>Adam</hi> was made mutable, so that his power to sinne did not arise from his <hi>liberty,</hi> but his <hi>changeablenesse.</hi> Let it not then trouble us to say, How could Christ be said to obey, seeing he could do no otherwise? <hi>for to be able to sinne is not constitutive of, or ingredient to liberty.</hi> Christ had a willing and ready dominion over his acts, and in this was his liberty. That Christ did not, or could not but obey, did not arise from a naturall necessity determining him, as the fire doth burn or the sunne shine, but from the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:118921:183"/> perfection of his holy Nature. This doctrine about Christs obedience doth also trouble the Remonstrants, who plow with the same Heifer that the Jesuites do, and therefore they say, (<hi>Apolog. pro Confessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ag.</hi> 188.) That Christs obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was of another nature then ours; Christ (say they) obeyed the will of his Father, not as we do, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of eternal death, if we do not obey; God forbid: but as an Ambassadour his King, or as a beloved son his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when a King or a father commit any honourable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment or service to him, that he may perform it, adding a promise of a most munificent remuneration if he will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it freely and for his sake; therefore, they say, Christ might not have undertaken this office of a Surety, or when he had undertaken it, he might have relinquished it, or he might not have delighted in the reward promised. Thus they are forced into precipices, that are driven by that inamoured doctrine of indifferency and indeterminateness ingredient to all liberty. Its true indeed, Christ might have refused to have been our Surety, if it had been of necessity, it could not be by the Scripture so magnified to be of grace. It was a free and spontaneous offering of himself, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God;</hi> and although he had an infinite love to Gods glory, yet that did not necessitate him to undertake to redeem man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, more then the apostate Angels. But when Christ had once agreed with the Father, and accepted of this Office, then he could not <hi>subterfuge,</hi> nor did it stand with his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and holiness to relinquish it. They were then given by the Father to him, <hi>John</hi> 17. as his charge and as his trust, and therefore he could not be found unfaithfull therein: Christ did obey the Father, though such was his perfection and immutable holinesse, that he could not do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
                  <p>Third Propos. Notwithstanding this position, that Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> did truly and properly obey, yet you must understand it in a right sense, for in some considerations Christ could not be said to obey: for in Christ we are to consider two Natures, his Divine and his humane: in respect of his Divine Nature, he could not be subject to the Father, for so he was of the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:118921:184"/> same equal Nature, and indeed its a contradiction to say, that God can be bound to obey, for that would imply he was not God, that there was a greater and more Supream then He.</p>
                  <p>Again, Christ may be considered in respect of his personal subsistence, and that being Divine, in that respect he could not be said to be obedient or subject to any Law. The Arians were condemned for holding Christ in respect of his <hi>supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> to be subject to a Law, for they made this only an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane subsistency. The Nestorians also, because they affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christ had a twofold suppositality, Divine and Humane, and in respect of his Humane to be subjected, were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise condemned. If therefore Christ be considered in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his subsistency, this being wholly Divine, so that he is a Divine and not an Humane <hi>suppositum</hi> or person sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, then he cannot be said properly to obey: And upon this account it is that Divines of great note, will not yield to the adversaries of Christs active obedience, that he was bound to the Law of God for himself, but that he was above the Law, and therefore what he did, he did wholly for us, being no more bound to obey the Law, then to suffer: for seeing (they say) that Laws are properly given not to natures, but to persons subsisting, and Christ was Divine, as a person sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, therefore he could not be under a Law: But how farre this hath truth, is in time to be discussed: and we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourth Propos. That Christ considered as a man, and in respect of his humane nature, might, and did properly obey; and if we believe Christ to be a man it must needs be so: for seeing the humane nature of Christ had not a supream essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and infinite holiness, in which sense Christ said, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.17. <hi>None is good but God,</hi> it was impossible that it should be above all rule of holiness, and though a creature, yet not subjected to the rule of all holiness, which is Gods increated will, and therefore when Christ is called the <hi>servant</hi> of God, its a proper and not a metaphorical speech, as when he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>vine</hi> and a <hi>door:</hi> and indeed to deny obedience to Christ, as he was man, is to overthrow our whole Redemption.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:118921:184"/> Neither may we look upon Christ in the state of a Mediatour, as the Remonstrants say an Ambassadour or a beloved son, as if there were only a mutual and friendly agreement between the Father and the Sonne, but there was a subordination and humiliation, in which sense Christ cals the Father Lord, and he cals him his servant.</p>
                  <p>But in the fifth place, Christ was in this obedient way to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the Father, only while he was in the flesh, I say, while he was in the flesh, not as if Christ had now deposited his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, or were not still man, but alluding to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. when he saith, <hi>Christ in the daies of his flesh offered up praiers and supplications with tears;</hi> so that though a Sonne, yet <hi>he learned obedience by the things which he suffered.</hi> So that the humane nature of Christ, while in the state of humiliation, did properly and truly obey the Law of God: And in this sense Christ saith, his <hi>Father is greater then he, John</hi> 14.28. not only in respect of his humane nature, but also of that state of humiliation he was in; he was not yet exalted to that glory, to sit at the right hand of God, and to be in visible Majesty and glory equal to God the Father; and this may be part of the meaning of that place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Henceforth know we not Christ after the flesh, though we have known him so:</hi> That is, we look upon him now as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen again, as glorified, as becoming a new Christ, as it were, he is now exalted, and not subject to those frailties, nor in that state of humiliation as we once knew him to be in. The humane nature therefore of Christ, while in the state of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation was subject to the Law of God, and so capable of obedience: This is to be observed, for Christ might have taken our nature upon him in a glorified way, and not in a servile: To be above the Law, and not made under the Law. As the humane nature of Christ now is in heaven, it doth not cease to be a creature; yet we cannot say, Christ is there in a state of obedience; for although the humane nature of Christ doth love God, and delight in him, yet it doth not this from subjection but from perfection. The holiness it puts forth in heaven, is not so much to be considered as a duty, but as part of that beatitude and glory it hath: Its obedience
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:118921:185"/> not formally but materially; to be sure its not such as to which a promise is made. Those that deny Christs active o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience imputed to us, because it was a debt which every creature oweth to God, and so he was obliged to this, may do well to consider, that the humane nature of Christ, though glorified in heaven, is yet a creature, but the holy actions thereof are not by way of a duty so properly, but are parts of its blessedness. But of this more in its time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixth Propos. It may not then be denied, that Christ in respect of his humane nature, while in the state of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was truly subjected to the Law, and so under obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: a twofold law he was subjected unto, one generall, whereby he obeyed that Law which was common to all other men with him. in which sense, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. he saith, <hi>he came to fulfill the Law,</hi> which was not only by doctrinall exposition of it, but by practicall obedience to it, yea not onely the Moral Law, but even the Ceremonial Law also, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was given to sinners, and denoted some kinde of expiation, yet Christ subjected himself to it, not for himself, but for us, who were sinners, that so the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the righteousnesse of all the Law of God might be fulfilled in us.</hi> The particular Law he was subject unto, was that peculiar precept of dying for us. Now that Christ was truly obedient unto the Father, and subjected thus to the Law, may appear part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by those texts wherein his obedience is spoken of, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. where he is called <hi>Gods righteous servant,</hi> partly and more principally in that God is said to command him, and he is said to keep his commands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Hence Propos. 7. Christs obedience was truly so, because it was done to his Fathers command, which was truly and really a command, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.37. compared with <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18. So Christ doth often call his Fathers will, in the work of our Redemption, a command, <hi>John</hi> 12. <hi>John.</hi> 14. <hi>John</hi> 15.10. <hi>If you keep my Commandments ye shall abide in my love, as I keep my Fathers Command, and abide in his.</hi> Neither may these texts be expounded of a permission and not a command, for if so, then Christ might as well not have been our Redeemer as our Redeemer, yea he might have deserted it, after he had
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:118921:185"/> begun it, without any sinne at all: But this could not be, for had not a Law or command required this of Christ, his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse which he wrought for us could not be called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; neither could Christ himself, or we in him, be said to be dead to the Law, if that had not been satisfied; yea then Christ could not have said that notable profession, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.7, 8, 9. <hi>My ears hast thou opened; Behold I come to do thy will O God: Thy Law is within my heart.</hi> As then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Christ gave his Disciples were truly and properly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, not permissions, or bare insinuations of a will, so was that which Christ had of the Father, for in that of <hi>John</hi> 15.18. he makes them of the same nature.</p>
                  <p>Propos. 8. Though Christs obedience was properly to a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> command, yet this command was not imposed on him to the same ends as it is on men, for a command is given us for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to instruct the minde, and to quicken or stirre up the heart; but Christ needed neither of these, for his minde was fully indowed with all knowledge, and his heart was full of all ready affections to do Gods will; therefore he said it was his <hi>meat and drink to do his Fathers will.</hi> No hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry or thirsty man could more desire the relieving of those appetites, then he longed to do his Fathers command: If you ask whether this command had a threatning to it, for if not to obey would have been a sinne, then eternall death would have followed, and so the commination of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would have been by way of addition to the command im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on him, as it is on us, But that is not necessary, for the command was not given to him, to stirre and quicken him up to his duty, as it is to us, but for other ends: Yea a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Divine (<hi>Cloppen. syntag.</hi> pag. 469.) doth acknowledge, that Christ was under the commination of the Law, but yet this did not strike any terrour into Christ, because the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in it self doth only inform of Gods hatred against sinne, it doth not inflict terrour but by accident, supposing a man to be fallen by sinne. Therefore <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity had a threatning joyned to that explanatory command, which yet could not strike terrour into him, till he had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Indeed this did inform him, how much God hated
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:118921:186"/> such transgression, and so thereby might inflame him to hate sin the more: But of this more, when we consider how Christ was under the Law. And certainly, the more we consider that Christ was in an obediential way, and became like a servant subject to God: As it did more debase him, so it ought to stirre us up to more thankfulnesse, and to make us say of every Law of Christ, which he did of that will of God to be our Redeemer, <hi>Behold, I come to do thy will, thy Law is within my heart.</hi>

                     <hi>condemnation.</hi> Besides, this is the wilfull and grosse mistake of <hi>Stapleton</hi> and his fellows, that they oppose true real righteousnesse, to imputed, which the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox again and again disavow: Imputed righteousnesse and inherent differ not in their truth and reality, one is as true and as real a righteousnesse as another, but in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of communication or participation. We say, its as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be made righteous without righteousnesse, as to be healthfull without health, to be wise without wisdome; onely we say, its not necessary this righteousnesse should be inherent, it may be by anothers obedience procured for us, and so judged as if we had done it. Indeed there are some
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:118921:187"/> things that do necessarily import an inherency in the Subject, and such things cannot be imputed, as health doth imply a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity in existency, but righteousnesse is of another nature; we may in Law be acquitted by anothers satisfaction, or by the obedience of a Surety pronounced to have obeyed the Law, and here is no contradiction in this; and that this must necessarily be so interpreted here, appeareth by the oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience we were made sinners, not only by propagation, but by imputation; <hi>Adams</hi> sinne was ours by imputation; It was not onely the private personal sinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> but the publique transgression of all. Thus Christs obedience was the obedience of all those he did undertake for. Its true, the imputed sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> to all mankinde, did cause inherent corruption in all; and thus we also grant, That the imputed righteousnesse of Christ doth work in us inherent righteousnesse, but this is not that by which we are freed from condemnation. And as for the use of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the place he first instanceth in maketh against him, for to that we may adde others of the like nature, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. where the word signifieth a legal constituting and appointing of a person to some office or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment: and thus it doth in this place signifie a legal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting and making of us just, that whereas before the Law did in every thing accuse us, we are now acquitted and declared righteous.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see the Text vindicated, and this Proposition genuinely built thereon, <hi>That a believer is made righteous, not by his own, but by Christs obedience,</hi> and it hath been clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by obedience is meant in a general sense, his conformity to the whole Law and will of God, not that particular obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience onely manifested in his death on the Crosse. And thus <hi>Calvin</hi> upon this place, We could not be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unlesse we bring the perfect obedience of the Law, and that we cannot, but Christ must do it for us: So that it is to be wondered he should be brought in the number of those who are against Christs active obedience in this controversie, seeing he doth in so many places averre it.<note place="margin">Propositions to clear the point.</note>

                  <p>Before we come to establish this truth, some Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:118921:187"/> must be laid down to clear it. As</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That the obedience of Christ hath in this later age (by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> reason of different opinions newly raised) been divided into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and passive, calling his active that which was in obedience to the command of the Law, and his passive that which was in satisfying the penalty of it.</hi> Now this distinction hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected upon two grounds:</p>
                  <p>The first (for which well it might) was for the absurd impropriety of it, calling it passive obedience,<note place="margin">A censure of the terms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive obedience.</note> as if we should say active passion, for passion <hi>quâ</hi> passion, or a meer suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of punishment cannot be any satisfaction, or merit any reward. There must be an obediential resignation of a mans self, with readinesse and chearfulnesse to suffer, else it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be available; and therefore to speak properly, All obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is active; even thus when it is in things to be suffered. Therefore more sutably to the Scripture we may say, <hi>The obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his Passion, then passive obedience:</hi> Yea, Divines say, <hi>That all the actions of Christ had passion in them, and all his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions actions in them, from the very beginning to the end his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was with suffering, and his suffering with obedience.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reject this distinction, as being the Engine of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants</hi> to divide and rent the Orthodox asunder. Thus <hi>Lubbertus [contra Bert. &amp; contra Vorst.]</hi> doth several times disclaim it, attempting to be a Conciliator in the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, though enclining to the Doctrine of passive obedience only. But whether they were the authors or the fomentors of it, it lieth upon him to make good. Now although it be thus rejected, yet for distinction sake, and because these terms are now generally used, I shall give them the titles of active and passive obedience of Christ, although I think, it were better to avoid them, and in stead thereof to say, the whole humiliation of Christ in all the particular acts thereof are made over to us for our righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>You may take notice, that this controversie at least <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> under these terms, is but of late originals.</hi> Not but that the Doctrine of Christs active obedience imputed unto us, was asserted in Antiquity, as learned men shew, but the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie was not then agitated. The <hi>Lutherans, Meisner, Brock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:118921:188"/> Himelius,</hi> &amp;c. make <hi>Piscator</hi> to be the first Authour of this opinion, <hi>That Christs passive obedience is onely imputed to us for righteousnesse.</hi> But <hi>Lucius</hi> a learned Writer in this controversie, and appearing for the active obedience of Christ, saith [<hi>apud Gat. Animad. partis prioris. Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 15.] That the controversie first began amongst the <hi>Lutherans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>George Kargius</hi> (against whom <hi>Gomarus</hi> hath defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the truth) and his collegues, which controversie was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the Divines of <hi>Wittenburg</hi> to be discussed and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who gave in their judgement for the active obedience of Christ, yet amongst the <hi>Calvinists</hi> some did imbrace it, as <hi>Olevian,</hi> from whom, as being his Master, <hi>Piscator</hi> suckt it, and afterwards with much animosity propugned it, and since some few have gone that way. So that for any to say, <hi>Vulgar unstudied Divines (except some few) do maintain the active obedience of Christ in the sense afterwards to be mentioned, is out of fear to vulgarity to runne into singularity:</hi> For gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines do make the active obedience of Christ with the passive, to be our compleat righteousnesse; And for the <hi>Calvinists, Beza Annot. in cap.</hi> 5. <hi>ad Rom. v.</hi> 17. <hi>Junius Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Thes. de Justif. Polanus Symph. Cattol. cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Thes.</hi> 10. <hi>Grynaeus, Gomarus, Wallaeus, Lucius, Andraeas Rivetus, Cocceius, Cloppenhugius, Amesius,</hi> &amp;c. Insomuch that <hi>Vorstius</hi> said truly to <hi>Lubbertus,</hi> that it was the opinion of the chiefest Doctors of the Reformed Church [<hi>Vorst.</hi> 52. <hi>apud Sybrand.</hi>] Neither may those English Divines be called Vulgar, who have professedly avouched it, <hi>Perkins [Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Catholick] Davenant, Downame [of Justification]</hi> and others. Its true, we are not in matter of Doctrine pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily to look to any men or confessions, this is to call some men masters on earth: And <hi>Durand</hi> saith well, <hi>Omnis homo dimittens rationem propter authoritatem humanam, incidit in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipientiam bestialem.</hi> But yet when a Doctrine is decried ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the paucity or illiteratenesse of the patrons thereof, then its necessary to shew who have not been ashamed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in publique for it. Its true, some (though but few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively) have appeared against Christs active obedience, and some of them acknowledged to be men of eminent
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:118921:188"/> worth. But as <hi>Augustine</hi> of old to the <hi>Maniches</hi> spake ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well in controverted matters, <hi>Nemo nostrum dicat, jam se invenisse veritatem, sic eam quaeramus quasi ab utris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que nesciatur.</hi> Thus let all considerations of men and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity be a while seposited, as if the truth were already found out to our hands; but let us by the Scripture and Arguments deducible from it, so search for it, as if hitherto neither party had attained unto it.</p>
                  <p>Only the third <hi>Proposition may be to advertize, That even <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> amongst those who oppose the imputation of Christs active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the sense to be mentioned, there is a difference. Piscator</hi> and those that rigidly follow him, limit our righteousnesse onely to Christs death, as the whole and compleat matter of our satisfaction; and as for his active obedience, they make that onely a qualification in him, who is the Mediator: They do not say, It was needlesse, or that in some sense it was not for our good, onely they affirm the proper and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate effect of it, was to fit and dispose him to be our Mediator, and this they understand of his habitual holinesse, and not onely so, but of his actual also, which seemeth to be very strange Doctrine; for by this it will follow (as is to be more largely shewed) that Christ was not a qualified or fit Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for us, till he had accomplished the last act of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for if it be onely to qualifie him to be our Mediatour, then till he had fulfilled all his actual obedience, he could not have been our Mediator and Surety. Others they would have the controversie buried; and <hi>Ʋrsin, Paraeus, Lubbertus,</hi> though they be produced against Christs active obedience, yet they take upon them to be Conciliators, rather then to joyn to either party. <hi>Paraeus</hi> is said [<hi>Lubbert. contra Bertium, pag.</hi> 25] to call the Disputes about the active and passive obedience of Christ <hi>inanes rixas,</hi> but I cannot in my Edition finde those expressions; indeed he limits the obedience in my Text to that of Christs death (of which more afterwards.) Yet he grants, That Christ fulfilled the general Law, and that special Law also of a Redeemer. To be sure <hi>Paraeus [Comment. in Heb.</hi> 5.8.] saith, <hi>Some dispute about the active and passive obedience of Christ,</hi> Quidni utraque? <hi>Why are we
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:118921:189"/> not justified by both?</hi> And very remarkable at the 9<seg rend="sup">th</seg> verse of the 5<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Chapter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he addeth, <hi>That the effect of our salvation doth not flow from any part of his actions or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, but from the whole work of Redemption most fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished by him. Therefore we are not to divide Christ, or distract faith, seeking one part of our righteousnesse in his birth, another in habitual sanctity, another in integrity of life, another in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of death.</hi> To this last I fully subscribe, but how it will consist with their other Positions, I see not. <q>Others [M. <hi>Brad. of Justif. cap.</hi> 13. M. <hi>Gatak. Animad. pag.</hi> 2.] distinguish of Christs obedience, his legal obedience, and his servile: His legal obedience was that which consisted in conformity to the Law, and flowing from his most pure nature: His servile obedience is that which was done by him as in a state of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; for Christ, though he took our nature upon him might have been immediately received into heaven, and so not have subjected himself to the Law in that debased man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he did. So that these learned Authors do not make that actual obedience to be a qualification of him for to make an atonement for us by his death. But grant these particular acts of his obedience are imputed to us, and make up our compleat righteousnesse with his sufferings.</q> Thus we see the dissent amongst those, that yet deny the imputation of Christs active obedience to us for our righteousnesse. But yet because these Authors do grant the imputation of Christs obedience in some sense, and deny in it other, Therefore</p>
                  <p>A fourth Proposition is, <hi>That the full understanding of this truth, lieth in a right explication of the manner how we are made partakers of Christs righteousnesse.</hi> We are in the dark, and cannot avoid confusion till we separate the light from the darknesse, by declaring in what way we are advantaged by Christs righteousnes; for seeing an imputation of Christs obedience in his doings, as well as his sufferings unto us, is acknowledged by all the Orthodox, yea and by Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; therefore here is the difficulty to know, how its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and how its not. Now we may conceive this imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion possible two wayes:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:118921:189"/>1. That which is called by some virtually in opposition to formally, that is, when the whole obedience of Christ is made ours, that is, say they, for our good, for our benefit and advantage, but not so as to be our righteousnesse it self. And thus some hold no other imputation of it, but in this sense, that all which Christ did, yea and all that he had, even his whole being was for our great advantage. Though the instance will not hold every way, yet it may well represent it, when <hi>Paul</hi> said, He suffered for the Churches sake, the meaning is not, as if <hi>Pauls</hi> sufferings were imputed to the Church, as Christs were, only they did tend to the good of the Church many wayes: So, say they, Christs habitual and actual holinesse did in many respects tend to our spiritual good, to our Justification, but are not any part of our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. Here is an imputation granted, but in a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote way.</p>
                  <p>Others, and they are Popish writers, grant an imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this sense, that his merits and satisfaction are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and applied to us, so that thereby we are inabled to fulfill the Law perfectly, and to satisfie God: So that Christs righteousnesse which he did, is not made our righteousnesse, but its the cause or merit of our righteousnesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ is our righteousnesse with them, as <hi>David</hi> cals God often, his strength and his salvation, in a causal sense. Thus they grant an imputation in this sense, as if we should say, a mans money is accounted for his food and raiment, not that he feedeth on his money, or weareth his money, but because by this he he can procure them: So say they, Christs righteousnesse and obedience, its not that in which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately we appear before God, and look to be justified by, but it procureth and obtaineth a righteousnesse for us.</p>
                  <p>Others, they say, There is an imputation of Christs obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and its part of our righteousnesse, but then they will not yeeld, that it should be so particularly applied to us, as that it should be equivalent to our keeping of the Law, or we might be said to fulfill the Law in him. Here is an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation likewise of Christs active obedience, but none rise up to that fulnesse as the fourth and last explication doth, which
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:118921:190"/> positively determine, <hi>That Christs active obedience is in the same way required as his passive:</hi> So that as in Christ suffering we were looked upon by God, as suffering in him: So by Christs obeying of the Law we were beheld, as fulfilling the Law in him: Insomuch that the active obedience is in the same manner imputed to us, as the passive; and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid down by them, is this, That a passive righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is not all the righteousnesse we are bound to have: Its not enough to have satisfied the penalty of the Law. There is a perfect obedience still expected from us: So that he who would appear in an universal compleat righteousnesse before God, must bring not only a satisfaction to the punishment, but a conformity to the Law, and they judge it a great dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating from Christ, and making him but half a Saviour, to affirm otherwise; and certainly if we do attend to what was our duty, and what the Office was Christ undertook for us, it seemeth to be very clear, that both the active and passive obedience of Christ, must concurre to make up our compleat righteousnesse. Though some Divines call it our formal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, yet (as hath been said) because that expression is subject to logical disputes, we may call it our legal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, or that matter whereby we stand justified, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly before God: the one is not enough without the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, <hi>It must be considered, That even amongst those that hold our Justification by Christs active righteousnesse, there are differences also.</hi> For there is a three-fold righteousnesse in Christ, 1. That which is essential, as he is God. 2, His ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual. 3. His actual. For his essential righteousnesse, as God; none have appeared to hold the imputation of that, but <hi>Osiander,</hi> and what followers he had, which opinion was almost like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s gourd, that did presently wither, and is by many Arguments confuted by <hi>Calvin,</hi> and therefore I shall not stand on that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is his habitual righteousnesse, and some affirm this to be imputed to us for our righteousnesse to cover our original and habitual corruption. But some deny this, as thinking that rather qualifying and constituting of him, and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:118921:190"/> so no more imputable to us, then his natures are; for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate holinesse was only <hi>praesuppositivè</hi> and <hi>materialiter</hi> in him, as the Schools use to expresse such things, and was of the same consideration with his being and subsistency. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There is his actual obedience, whereby in an expressed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he conformed himself to the Law of God, whatsoever it was either</hi> general <hi>and natural, which all men were obliged unto, or more</hi> special <hi>and positive, which the Jews and children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham were bound unto; or yet more</hi> particular <hi>of a Redeemer and a Saviour, which he himself onely was obliged unto. This actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conformity unto the Law of God thus specified, is that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse</hi> (say others) <hi>which is made ours, and by his obedience unto it we are made righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Propositions thus stated,<note place="margin">Arguments for the imputation of Christs active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> the <hi>first Argument</hi> for the imputation of Christs righteousnesse, is to be established up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Text; for its a pregnant place, and speaks directly and positively what is contended for, <hi>viz. That by Christs obedience a believer is made righteous,</hi> whereas in other places <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Justification is attributed to his bloud,<note place="margin">From the Text <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19.</note> here it is to his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and that in a general unlimited sense. That this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may stand valid, its good to vindicate it from all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; some have said that its meant of inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, as if to be made righteous was to be inwardly san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified: but that hath been refused. Others, they limit this obedience, to the particular obedience of Christ, which was demonstrated in dying for us: This hath also been removed by several reasons.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore consider what Arguments they have to move them to this interpretation. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Its said, That which is here named in the Text, <hi>The obedience of one,</hi> is <hi>vers.</hi> 18, called <hi>one righteousnes:</hi> Now if it was but <hi>one righteousnes,</hi> that cannot be applied to the several acts of righteousness, which Christ performed in his life time.</p>
                  <p>To this we answer, That it is readily granted, that <hi>verse</hi> 17. and 18. it may be, if we regard the original, as well one offence, as the offence of one: Therefore its so in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint of the Bible; and indeed as <hi>Beza</hi> well notes, If it were
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:118921:191"/> not so in <hi>vers.</hi> 17. there would seem to be a needlesse redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy; for thus its translated, <hi>by one mans offence</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Death reigned by one;</hi> the later <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> seems to be tautological, unlesse you understand the former by <hi>one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> not <hi>one mans offence.</hi> Therefore an emphatical expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is to be put upon those passages, by that <hi>offence of one,</hi> and by that <hi>righteousnesse of one.</hi> But though this be granted in those verses, yet this Text doth expresly name <hi>man, By one mans disobedience,</hi> and <hi>by the obedience of one</hi> (though man be not in the Original, yet a person is supposed) So that we must forsake the very letter of the Scripture if we expound it so.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, its further pleaded, That we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it onely of Christs obedience in his death, because of the opposition between <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience and Christs obedience. <hi>Now</hi> (say they) <hi>as Adams disobedience, which did condemn us, was one sinne; so Christs obedience which must justifie us, is but one act of obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But first, There is not the same reason of <hi>Adams</hi> disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Christs obedience in every thing; and certainly the Apostle maketh a great dissimilitude as well as agreement, and it may seem even in this very thing at <hi>vers.</hi> 17. for there the Apostle makes it one sinne <hi>that brought death,</hi> but its the <hi>abundance of grace,</hi> and <hi>the gift of righteousnesse that brings life.</hi> The opposition lieth between <hi>Adams</hi> one sin, and Christs abundance of righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Again, There is not the same reason, because one sinne is enough to condemn; but more then one act of obedience is required to justifie; hence we say, Though <hi>Adam</hi> condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all, yea the greater part of man shall be actually damned, and Christ he justifieth and saveth but a few, yet Christ the second <hi>Adam</hi> is more potent then the first, because there is required more efficacy to save one, then is to condemn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; as there is to restore one man to life, more then to kill many.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, Christs obedience may be called one, even as <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience; for as Divines say, His sinne was not one single, simple sin, but many sins, were ingredient therein,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:118921:191"/> which made it to be a very hainous transgression: Thus Christs whole obedience, is but one entire and compleat obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience consisting of many acts, even as the adversaries must acknowledge Christs sufferings was one compleat obedience integrated of many particular kindes of sufferings, for it was not one numericall suffering that procured our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, he suffered from men and from God, in his body and in his soul, extream grief and torment in his body, as also the sense of Gods wrath in his soul, as <hi>Piscator</hi> doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

                     <hi>verse</hi> of this Chapter, its said, <hi>By the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of one, the free gift came upon all to Justification of life:</hi> yea <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. the work of our Redemption is wrought by Christ in the whole state of his humiliation, <hi>Being in the form of ae servant, and obedient unto death, even the death of the cross:</hi> Where all that obedience he shewed unto God, antecedently to his death is taken notice of; and what is it to be redeemed from the curse of the Law, but to be justified? yet that <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. is attributed unto <hi>Christs being under the Law;</hi> so that we see Christs death is not every where expressed as the cause of our Justification and Redemption.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its granted, that in very many places our Justification, and forgivenesse of sinnes is attributed to the death of Christ, but not exclusively or negatively, so as to deny the other acts of his obedience, but because in this was demonstrated most eminently his obedience, as also his love to us: We are then by his death to understand, <hi>all that course of humiliation he did so willingly undergo, which was at last consummated in his death.</hi> And this may well satisfie the Piscatorians, for seeing they hold that it was not meerly Christs death that was an atonement, but as laid down by him who in his soul was fully apprehensive of the wrath of God against sinne; so that those sufferings in his soul made the greatest part of a sacrifice for our sinnes, it must needs follow, that by death they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not barely mean death, but something more. And as the strict adhering to the words death and blood, would exclude the sufferings of his soul, so all his other sufferings, which yet the Scripture takes great notice of, the reproaches and revilings he indured, but especially those agonies and great conflicts he had, while in the garden with his Disciples, that were before his death. It is a good rule and of use in this case, <hi>In Homogeneis connexis &amp; subordinatis unius inclusio non est alterius exclusio.</hi> But its good to follow the Scripture in the universal extent of it in describing all that is done for us by Christ: some remove his active obedience, restraining it to his passive; others they detruncate his passive obedience, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:118921:192"/> away the greatest part of that, and limit it to a bodily suffering: Then come others at the last, and they take away even his bodily suffering also, as to be any imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse to us by way of satisfaction to the justice of God, so that its dangerous to remove those Land marks the Scripture hath set us; when you once begin to take any part away of Christs humiliation, as not imputed to us, its hard to say where you will stay: and its again and again to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whether by the same reason you take away part, you do not remove all; certainly the Socinian thinketh by the same blow to beat down all.</p>
                  <p>The next Answer <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> that is runne unto as a sanctuary, is, <hi>That the opposition seemeth to necessitate us, that we restrain it to pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive obedience only: for thus they observe, As the disobedience by</hi> Adam <hi>was not a transgression of the morall and generall Law, which did binde him as a man, but it was a special command by way of trial, and obliging only in that case: so the obedience of Christ must be not to the morall and generall Law, but to some speciall command, which was to be a Mediatour, and so to die for us.</hi> But its well observed by the Antagonists, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reply. </seg>
                     </label> that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle makes the opposition between <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience, and Christs obedience, as the disease and the remedy, and so we must look for a contrariety, not an identity at least in the manner of curing, otherwise we must say it behoved Christ to have a command about the eating or not eating of the fruit of some tree, that so the obedience and disobedience might have agreed. Every one seeth absurdity in this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. In the second place, <hi>Adam</hi> in transgressing that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive special command, did at the same time sinne against the generall and morall Law, its impossible to break any positive precept, and not to break the generall Law of God; for the morall Law of God requireth obedience unto him in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he shall require, only positive commands may specifie or institute some matter or <hi>medium,</hi> which was not expresly commanded by the morall Law. Thus all the ceremoniall worship which was introduced by positive precepts, yet is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the second Commandment.</p>

And although men imagine severall senses and waies of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of righteousness, yet that is no more to be regarded in this point, then in other Doctrinal Controversies, when the Orthodox seeing those many texts of Scripture, which speak of Christs dying for us, to prove a satisfactory atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the justice of God, by this death, and that it is in our stead, as if we had suffered: If a <hi>Socinian</hi> caviller should say, that they argue from a general to a determinate manner, Christ might die for example and for doctrine, not for satisfaction, or there may be a metaphoricall and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per redeeming, would this be admitted as of any validity? no certainly: For its not enough to put many senses and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations upon the place, and then to say, The Scripture doth not prove it, unless it specifie such or such a sense: This is to make it impossi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     </label> this fully would require a large Tractate; It cannot be denied but the objection is very considerable, and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:118921:194"/> of great consequence: for <hi>Austin</hi> said well, (<hi>lib. de peccato Origi. cap.</hi> 14.) That in the cause of those two men, <hi>Adam</hi> and Christ, whereof by the one we are sold under sinne, and by the other we are redeemed from sinne, the Christian faith doth properly consist. That we are made sinners by <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience, is so plainly and positively set down in this text, that none can deny it: But how we are, that is controverted. The Pelagians of old, understood it by imitation only: but because infants die, which yet could not imitate <hi>Adam,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hath been easily refuted.</p>
                  <p>Others interpret to be a sinner, to be guilty; as sinne is often put for guilt, and so they will not yield, that we have properly the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> made ours, only we are <hi>sub reatu,</hi> not <hi>culpâ,</hi> under guilt, not sinne by him.</p>
                  <p>Others, they grant we are made sinners by him, but inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, by natural propagation.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Those that seem to have the truth on their sides, affirm, that we are not only made sinfull by him, being born of him that was an unclean root, but that also his very actual transgression was made ours: That his sinne was not only <hi>Adams</hi> personal actual sinne, but also by Covenant and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the sinne of all mankinde. Its true that custome and use in the Church of God, doth now call that only Original sinne, which every one hath as soon as he is born, but yet <hi>Adams</hi> first actual transgression may be called Original sinne, in an active sinne, as being the cause of that original passive sinne in us; now if this be so, then as <hi>Adams</hi> actual disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was ours by imputation, so Christs obedience is also ours in the like manner. Its true, some will hardly admit this, therefore <hi>Peltanus</hi> a Jesuite, (<hi>lib. de Origin. peccato,</hi> pag. 110, 111.) refuseth this opinion, which <hi>Catharinus</hi> and <hi>Piglius</hi> defended, for this reason amongst others, because, saith he, it doth plainly favour their errour, who in this age urge the figment of imputed righteousness. But <hi>Adam</hi> is not to be considered only as a <hi>root</hi> and a <hi>natural principle,</hi> but as a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique person,</hi> with whom God made a Covenant for himself and his posterity, that upon his persevering obedience, he and his posterity should be established in holiness and life,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:118921:194"/> but upon his disobedience, he and all his should be deprived of both. <hi>Now Adam who was then a publique Person, and a common Trustee, as it were, for all mankinde disobeying,</hi> we became sinners, <hi>not only by natural propagation, but by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The Covenant makes it to be our act as well as his, and this may appear to be true by these Reasons. First, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Apostle in this Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. saith, that <hi>in him all have sinned,</hi> whether it be <hi>in whom,</hi> or <hi>for that,</hi> all will come to one issue. All sinned in him, or because he sinned all sinned, which cannot be understood of any other, but <hi>Adams</hi> actual disobedience. Now to say, All sinned in him, is more then to say, All are made sinners by him: The one denoteth an act, the other an habitual qualification. If it were only said, We are made sinners by him, that might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force no more then what the opponents affirm, <hi>viz</hi> that by descent from him we have inherent pollution, that doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally constitute us sinners; but when we are so made sinners, that thereby we did sinne in him, we were <hi>peccantes,</hi> as well as <hi>peccatores:</hi> This cannot be any other way but by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or some compact. 2. If it were by natural propagation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we are made sinners by <hi>Adam,</hi> then there is no reason to attribute all to <hi>Adam,</hi> to one man, and to that one offence, for we may as well charge it upon all other immediate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as well as he. If you look only to natural descent, and set aside the Covenant and Imputation, then there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Adam</hi> and other parents, it might be as well said, we sinned in many men, as in one; and we might as well say, by any other mans disobedience we are made sinners, as by <hi>Adams.</hi> Again, If it were not by imputation, but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propagation, Why should that one disobedience of <hi>Adams</hi> be mentioned more then other sinnes? Why should not all those sinnes after his fall be pitched upon, as well as that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence onely? Is not all this because in that particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Adam</hi> was a publique person, and so covenanted with, and what he did was the act of all mankinde? as what the Master of a Society doth, if impowred thereunto, is the act of all the Society. Lastly, It must be by imputation, not natural descent, because if <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen, all Divines
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:118921:195"/> agree that not only himself, but his posterity had been crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with immortality and life. Indeed what kinde of life and blessedness it would have been is controverted, but immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and blessedness in the general is concluded on by all. Now <hi>Adams</hi> posterity could not be made partakers of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and blessedness, by meer natural propagation, there must be a Covenant necessarily presupposed to make this good; and it was at the meer good pleasure of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would convey such glorious priviledges or not: So that the Covenant God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> is that which takes all his posterity with him, and makes, as <hi>Austin</hi> said, <hi>Omnes homines ille unus homo,</hi> all men that one man: And therefore its observed that <hi>Adam</hi> is used both for <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> also, as being collectively all mankinde. Now if we come to speak of Christ, and our being made righteous by him, it will hold more strongly that his obedience must be ours by imputation, for he is not our natural root as <hi>Adam</hi> was to mankinde; what Christ did for us cannot become ours but by a Covenant and agreement, therefore some are made righteous by it, and not others; so that as by his passive obedience we are made righteous by imputation, and by a Covenant, thus it is also by his active obedience. And thus I have at last vindicated this first Argument, taken from the collation and comparison with the first and second <hi>Adam,</hi> from the many Objections I have any where read or observed against it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">II. Arguments from <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.</note>A second Argument to prove the imputation of Christs active obedience unto us, shall be from <hi>those several texts, which say, Christ either came to fulfill the Law, or that by him the righteousness of the Law was fulfilled in us, that Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness: That he was made under the Law to redeem us.</hi> These texts will strongly evince, That Christs active obedience and fulfilling the Law was for us, as well as the satisfying the penalty of it. Let us take the texts in order: The first is <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17, 18. <hi>I am come not to destroy the Law but to fulfill it,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Beza</hi> makes it a metaphor from untying bonds and losing them, because the Law is a bond to duty. <hi>Piscator</hi> makes it a metaphor from a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if you loosen the foundation, the whole fabrick will fall.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:118921:195"/> Which waies soever you take it, this is plain that Christ came not to destroy or overthrow the Law, but to fulfill it: To see the force of this text, consider</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That its undeniable by the Law, is meant chiefly, if not solely, the moral Law. So that whereas in other places, the evasion commonly is, that Christ fulfilled the ceremonial Law, because they were shadows, and he the body: This cannot be so here, for he doth plainly instance in the moral Law, at the 21. <hi>verse,</hi> and so along the Chapter: Its true, he saith, he came not to destroy the Prophets neither, but to fulfill them also, and that is, because whatsoever they had prophesied concerning him did come to pass: But this doth not weaken, yea it rather confirmeth, that as he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Prophets every way they could be fulfilled; so he did also the Law every way that could be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There may be a twofold fulfilling of the Law, meant in this expression. 1. A doctrinal fulfilling of it, by giving the true and pure meaning of it, against those corrupt glosses that were put upon it by the Pharisees. 2. A practical and obedientiall fulfilling of it, by a conformity to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it: Now Christ did fulfill the Law both waies, by a doctrinal interpretation of it, that is plain in the text; and by obedience, that is easily made good, as part of the sense, to fulfill the Law, as appeareth, <hi>vers.</hi> 19. For when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had said he came to fulfill the Law, he confirmeth it by two arguments: First, The immutability and perpetuity of the Law. Secondly, The danger and punishment of him, who shall break it, and that is not by false doctrine only but by disobedience: Therefore he saith, <hi>Whosoever shall break one of these commands, and teach men so to do.</hi> So that disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is one way of breaking the Law, and corrupt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it another way. Therefore our Saviour came to fulfill it by his true doctrine, and by his holy life; and this is acknowledged by <hi>Piscator,</hi> who upon this place saith, that Christ fulfilled the Law in himself and in us; in himself by the love of God, and in us, which he maketh true several waies. First, By working faith in us, whereby we lay hold upon Christ, who by his death removed the curse of the Law.
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:118921:196"/> Secondly, By inabling us to obey the Law in some measure: and thirdly, By chastising and afflicting of us when we go astray. But this seemeth not much to the purpose, though there may be some truth in it, for here lieth the Question, <hi>Whether Christ did obedientially fulfill the Law for us or not, or for himself only;</hi> if for us, as the Scripture makes the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his people, the ground of all that he did and suffered, then we have enough for our purpose out of the text. Its true, they distinguish between obeying <hi>pro nobis,</hi> in our stead, and <hi>propter nos,</hi> for our good. Even as the Socinians distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between Christs dying for us, and in our stead; but the same reasons which perswade to understand <hi>(for us)</hi> in matter of his death, to be <hi>in stead of us,</hi> will also concerning his <hi>obedience,</hi> as is more to be shewed. Its said likewise, that Christ obeyed the Law for himself, his humane nature being a creature, was by the obligation of the moral Law, bound to love God, and do those acts which are commanded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and so being due upon that ground, could not be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, as his sufferings could not have been made ours, if he had been bound to suffer for himself, but the discussing of this, will be most proper, when this Objection is brought in.</p>
                  <p>I therefore proceed to a second text, and that is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>That the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> Here we see plainly the great end why Christ came into the world, it was to condemn sinne; you have also the occasion of this, it was because the Law was impossible to us, we could not fulfill it, because of the adhering corruptions to us. Lastly, Here is the effect of this condemnation of sinne through Christ, <hi>That the righteousnesse of the Law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> The <gap reason="foreign">

This is fulfilled in us, so that whatsoever the Law could demand, that through Christ is accomplished in us. Now the right of the Law was in requiring two things: First, Satisfaction to the penalty of it, for that being broken there cannot be any
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:118921:196"/> hope till the justice of God be satisfied. But that is not all: Secondly, The right of the Law is to require perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, without which we cannot inherit life, and both these must be done for us in and by Christ; so that this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> was fulfilled in us, by Christs sufferings, and by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Its true some understand this of sanctification, because it followeth, <hi>Who walk not after the flesh but the spirit;</hi> but as the Apostle at the 5<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
                     <hi>verse</hi> brought this expression as a qualification of those who had no condemnation, so he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this verse to make it in those who have the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law fulfilled in them; &amp; if it were to be understood of sanctification, it would not be so properly spoken in the passive sense, for so we do rather fulfill the Law actively, though imperfectly, rather then have it fulfilled passively in us: I wonder therefore at <hi>Gomarus,</hi> an eminent and learned Author, with great assurance &amp; diligence propugning Christs active obedience, that he should in his analytical Expositions on this place, quit this Interpretation, and understand it of sanctification: His reason is no waies cogent, Because (saith he) the text saith, this righteousness is fulfilled in us, and not in Christ; but it is acknowledged by the Opponents, that the satisfaction of the penalty of the Law, is part of this <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which is also accomplished by Christ and in Christ for us; yet in the text its not said to be fulfilled in Christ. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its enough that the Apostle had in the verse before, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the end of Christs coming into the flesh, and so in and through that we come to have the righteousness of the Law fulfilled in us: Certainly the patient and willing suffering of the punishment of the Law, cannot be said to be all the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness the Law requireth.</p>

                     </gap>, <hi>sacrifices for sinne thou hast no pleasure in.</hi> Its true then that the Apostle speaketh of Christs offering himself a sacrifice and an atonement for sinne, and this admirable benefit doth hereby accrew to the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that sinne is condemned; he speaks of it as a person that now is disabled from accusing or laying any thing to our charge, sinne cannot accuse us any longer: Oh glorious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, sinne that did condemn all others, is now condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it self. We say a condemned person in Law cannot give in any witness, how wonderfully may faith improve this to quiet and comfort the conscience: Doth sinne accuse thee, doth that threaten condemnation to thee? say, Christ hath condemned it, that now it hath no more power to accuse: and as if this were not enough (as indeed it is not) there is a second benefit, <hi>that the righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in us</hi> by this means. Christ did not only by his sufferings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the curse, but by his absolute conformity to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Law, hath obtained for us a perfect obedience, so <hi>that the righteousnesse of the Law is fulfilled in us.</hi> This fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth most genuinely, yea and necessarily; for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of the Law could not be fulfilled in us, unlesse we had either by inherency or imputation, a perfect obedience made ours. Seeing therefore the Law cannot of it self allow or approve of any thing, but what is perfect, that cannot be said to be fulfilled, unlesse there be an absolute and full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to it. So that by Christ, the Law which was our enemy, is now reconciled to us; and that which did once curse us, cannot but blesse and approve of us, because it cannot reject, but approve the obedience of Christ.</p>
                  <p>A second Reply is made, <hi>That by fulfilling should be meant the accomplishment of such a righteousnesse, as the Law had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of, and so its parallel'd with that place where the Law is said to give witnesse of this righteousnesse,</hi> Rom. 3. <hi>and so its said, this is the most proper use of the word</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>the fulfilling of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third Text is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. where <hi>Christ</hi> is said to be <hi>the end of the Law for righteousnesse to him that believeth.</hi> Did not men obscure the Text with Interpretations, and so put a vail on it, the light of it would easily appear to this purpose; That whereas the Law had this for an end, to bring men to perfect obedience, and so to obtain Justification thereby, this through mans corruption being made impossible, yet through Christ the end of the Law is established, and so the Law is not destroyed, nor the intent of the Law-giver frustrated, for Christ is the end of it to him that believeth, and that for righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>I shall not insist long on this, because I have some where else handled this. Its true, some understand this of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, and so make Christ the end abolishing not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing, the <hi>finis interficiens,</hi> not <hi>perficiens,</hi> the <hi>finis consumens,</hi> not <hi>consummans;</hi> but seeing the Apostle argueth against the Jews, <hi>who sought to establish their own righteousnesse by the Law,</hi> we must take it in as large a sense as they did, and they thought by all the works they did to any kinde of Law God had commanded to be justified thereby: For although the dispute about Justification began at first by the ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Rites, yet afterwards it extended to all the works of the Law, as plainly appeareth by <hi>Pauls</hi> arguments. Therefore the Apostle at the 5<seg rend="sup">th</seg> verse describeth the righteousnesse of the Law, by doing those things, and so a man shall live; now they were not bound to do the things of the ceremonial Law only, but the moral Law also.</p>
                  <p>Again, If this were to be understood of the ceremonial
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:118921:198"/> Law only, that Christ came to abolish that <hi>Mosaical</hi> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, and so was the end of righteousnesse in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, then it would follow, That Christ was onely righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse in this sense to the believing <hi>Jew,</hi> not to the <hi>Gentile;</hi> for the beleeving <hi>Gentile</hi> was not bound to that ceremonial Law, neither did Christ abolish it as to them, seeing they were never under it. Certainly by this means, all we that are believers of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> can have no comfort in Christs being the end of the Law for righteousnesse. But see the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaking universally, <hi>Christ is the end of the Law for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse to him that believeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some understand this of the moral Law, and say, Christ was the end of it, because the Law did convince of sinne, and shew us our impotency, and so drive us to seek unto Christ; but this is a secondary use of the Law, and by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent meerly, otherwise the Law would have been the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of life as well as the Gospel. The primary use of the Law, and that which is intended <hi>per se,</hi> is to bring unto a perfect and compleat obedience. Look then on Christ, not only as the end of the ceremonial, but also the moral Law, and what obedience thereunto is defective in thee, see it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in Christ.</p>
                  <p>The last Text under this second kinde of Argument alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the imputation of Christs active obedience, shall be that famous and notable one, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.4, 5. where <hi>Christ</hi> is said <hi>to be made under the Law, that he might redeem us from the curse of the Law; He was made under the Law,</hi> both in respect of the mandatory part of it, and also the comminatory part of it. The Apostle doth there describe his being <hi>made of a woman, and made under the Law,</hi> to be the ground of our redemption from the curse of it.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Christ was under the obediential part of the Law for himself, and not for us.</hi>

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:118921:199"/> that, when he is said <hi>to be made of a woman.</hi> That which hath the greater colour is, That to be under the Law, doth imply to be under the curse of it, not the obedience, as when the godly are said not to be under the Law, but under grace: So that by this interpretation, it will reach onely to Christs death, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. but the phrase is not to be thus straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for we must take it in the same sense, as the Jews urged it, against whom the Apostle manageth this Epistle. Now when they desired to be under the Law, none can say, they intended to be under the condemning power and curse of the Law only. <hi>Tell me</hi> (saith the Apostle at <hi>vers.</hi> 21.) <hi>ye that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be under the Law;</hi> certainly they did not desire to be under the curse of the Law: Therefore the Apostle would take them off from seeking Justification by the works of any Law, and look wholly upon Christ, as both obeying and suffering for them. And thus we have ended those Texts that are brought under one head for a second Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> We proceed to a third, <hi>and that shall consist of such Texts as make us to be righteous in Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Argument from such texts as make us to be righteous in Christ, and not in our selves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</note>
                     <hi>and not in our selves, to be accepted of in him, to be compleat in him, and that we are to be found in him: All which do teach us thus much, That our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is of and in Christ. It is what he hath done for us, and not what we our selves do; and its good to adhere to these, because hereby Christ will be the more exalted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first Text is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He who knew no sinne, is made sinne for us, that we may be the righteousnesse of God in him.</hi> I have discussed this Text already, when I proved an imputed righteousnesse: Therefore briefly take notice of these three things in the verse.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We are made the righteousnesse of God,</hi> all believers are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributively made the righteousnesse of God, that is, not onely the righteousnesse which God hath procured, or which is accepted of by God, but a righteousnesse that is not a meer mans, therefore its said <hi>in him,</hi> who was both God and man, otherwise it might have been a righteousnesse of God in us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its said, <hi>A righteousnesse of God in him,</hi> to denote, That though it be ours by imputation, yet its subjectively in
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:118921:199"/> him. Not that this righteousnesse, as it is in him, is made ours, so that we should have the righteousnesse of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and an infinite righteousnesse, but so farre as we stood in need of it; Of which more in the Objections: Its then our righteousnesse by imputation, but in Christ, not in our selves. And</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider the comparison, <hi>We are made the righteousness of God in Christ, as he was made sinne for us.</hi> Not indeed in every respect; for in several particulars there is a dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but as to the matter intended by the Apostle, which is to shew, that as our sinnes laid on him, made him die, and endure the wrath of God, when yet he had no sinnes of his own, so his righteousnesse is made ours, when we had not that of our own which could answer the Law. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have spoken of this already, I proceed to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and that is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.6. <hi>He hath made us accepted of in the beloved. To be accepted of,</hi> implieth the end for which, and that is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, yea and for the present our persons and duties are also accepted of, but it is still in him. Now, seeing God is so holy and righteous that nothing can be accepted of with him to such eternal glory, but what is compleatly holy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that supposeth our acceptation to be grounded upon his obedience. And thus that known comparison of our appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Christs righteousnesse, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did in his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cloaths, doth suppose, that we are covered with Christs righteousnesse, as with a garment. To have sinne pardoned by the passive obedience of Christ, is but a limited and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained acceptation, <hi>viz. quoad hoc,</hi> so farre as not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre eternal judgement; but this Text speaks of an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal acceptation, even so to be received into the favour of God, as thereby to partake of all the glorious priviledges God hath promised in his Word. This Text will more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, if you joyn <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. where believers are said <hi>to be compleat in him, as in Christ their head.</hi> Thus as in him we are risen, as in him we sit in heavenly places; so in him we satisfie the justice of God, and in him we fulfill the Law. By vertue of this mystical union all that Christ hath is made ours, and
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:118921:200"/> what he did we are accounted of as to do it. Therefore the Church is called Christ, because of the intimate communion with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. Christ and believers make one my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical person, as what the natural or political head doth in that relation, all the proportionable members are said to do. Therefore <hi>Aquinas</hi> said truly, <hi>Opera Christi habent se ad mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra, sicut opera hominis constituti in gratiâ ad seipsum,</hi> If a man be holy, then his handes, his eyes, his minde, his will and affections are holy. Thus what Christ did as our head, is imputatively ours; for in these things he was a publique person, and acted in our behalf, not that he repented for us, and believed with a justifying faith for us, as some have fondly imagined; for these things, though graces in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet necessarly argue some imperfection in the subject where they are.</p>
                  <p>To these Texts we may adde the practical, and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal way which <hi>Paul</hi> took for comfort, when he would set himself before Gods Tribunal, and that is <hi>Phil</hi> 3.9. <hi>To be found in him, not having his own righteousnesse, but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse which is of God by faith. To be found in him,</hi> that doth notably imply, when the Law and Justice of God shall make enquiry after <hi>Paul,</hi> he would not, though so great an Apostle, and one who had laboured more then them all, yet he would not be found in himself. And certainly thus it is, as <hi>Contarenus</hi> an ingenuous Papist in this controversie hath well observed, The more grace and holinesse any man have attained unto, the more humble and modest they are in themselves, and the higher esteem they have of the imputed righteousnesse of Christ. Not but that they indeed grow more godly, onely hereby they see their own failings more, and the greater necessity of Christ, they are pleased in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves lesse, and are more contented and satisfied in Christ. Its he that lived for them, and he that died for them, Christ is <hi>all in all.</hi> Neither do they divide and separate Christs life and his death, but by faith receive whole Christ in all that he undertook for them.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> A fourth <hi>Argument is taken from such places where Christ is expresly called our righteousnesse,</hi> and is said <hi>to be made of</hi>
                     <pb n="367" facs="tcp:118921:200"/>
                     <hi>our righteousnesse,</hi> Jerem. 23.6. Jer. 33.16. 1 Cor. 1.30.<note place="margin">Arguments from such Scriptures where Christ is expresly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. &amp; 33.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</note> and which is very remarkable, he is said <hi>to bring in an everlasting righteousnesse,</hi> Dan. 9 24. All these places are very emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and not easily to be put by as some think they may. For the first</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. it is plain at the 5<seg rend="sup">th</seg> verse, that he whose name shall be called <hi>the Lord our righteousnesse</hi> is Christ, and that he doth not speak of God the Father for us at the 5<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
                     <hi>verse,</hi> he describeth his humane nature; so in this 6<seg rend="sup">th</seg> he declareth his Divine Nature, he is called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and properly attributed unto any creature, as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox prove against <hi>Socinians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As his two Natures are described, so also his Mediatory Office in that attribute, <hi>our righteousnesse;</hi> this is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of the Gospel, and that which Christ is made to us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is the believers thankfull acknowledgement and profession of it, <hi>He shall be called.</hi> To be called doth signifie not only the being of a thing, but the famous publishing and notifying of it: Every believer shall know where his strength lieth, where his comfort and righteousnesse is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured up, and that is in Christ, who is both the <hi>Branch</hi> and the <hi>Jehovah;</hi> This is most genuine, if we do regard the scope of the Prophet, and is received by the current of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, yet <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the place, applieth it to <hi>Judah,</hi> and not to Christ, as if the sense were, The name that <hi>Judah</hi> shall be called by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by righteousnesse doth understand (as sometimes the word is) beneficence and mercy; but every one may see this is to compell Scripture to go whether it would not.</p>
                  <p>The second Text is almost like this, if not the same, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 33.16. <hi>This is the name whereby she shall be called, The Lord our righteousnesse. Grotius</hi> thinketh this will confirm his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the former, for here, saith he, the city shall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thus, and there the people of <hi>Judah,</hi> there is the Mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Gender, here is the Feminine; but suppose it should be granted, that the right interpretation is, <hi>She shall be called</hi> (as our Translators do) yet <hi>Lapide</hi>'s observation upon the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:118921:201"/> place would much confirm the truth we contend for, That such is the union between Christ and the Church, that there is a communion unto it of all the good things Christ hath; and in 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.30. <hi>We are said</hi> (that is, the Church) <hi>to be the righteousnesse of God in Christ:</hi> Even as Christ maketh the persecution of the Church to reach to him, <hi>Saul, Saul, Why persecutest thou me?</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> on the other side, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I no longer live, but Christ in me.</hi> If then Christ be the Lord our righteousnesse, and this title is given her, for the near communion she hath with Christ who is her righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, then this doth greatly make for the imputation of Christs righteousnesse unto us. But that translation which <hi>Junius</hi> gives seemeth to be more consonant to the former place, and so makes both this and that alike, which is thus, <hi>And he that shall call her, is the Lord our righteousnesse:</hi> So that Christ the righteousnesse of the Church is here said to call his people to him.</p>
                  <p>The third Text confirming this, is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>We are of Christ, who is made of God to us, righteousnesse;</hi> Here you see <hi>He is righteousnesse, He is made righteousnesse, and he is made righteousnesse of God,</hi> and that <hi>to us,</hi> his righteousnesse was not for himself, but for us, and he is made it to us. To these places the Adversaries of imputation in the sense stated, though differing amongst themselves, yet all agree to give this answer, That Christ is made our righteousnesse causally and effectively, that is, he is the Author and cause of our righteousnesse: Even as God is often called by <hi>David,</hi> his strength, and his hope, yea and so Christ likewise is called, there being nothing so ordinary (say they) as to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate an efficient with that title, which is effected or wrought by him: and indeed its granted, That this answer might prevail, if the Scripture did not in other places manifest a nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer union between Christ and his people, then of a meer bare efficient; Christ is not onely made the cause of believers graces, but they are said <hi>to be in him,</hi> and <hi>to be made one with him,</hi> and he is their Surety and Mediator, which doth imply a nearer union, then a meer outward cause. Therefore I subjoyned these Texts to the former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:118921:201"/> of Christs Union with his people, that so the strength of them may be supported: And indeed the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry phrase to be <hi>made righteousnesse</hi> being distinct from that of being made Sanctification, must needs have some other sense, then of causality, for that is implied, <hi>in being made Sanctification to us,</hi> that is, the Authour of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteousnesse. Therefore to be made righteousnesse to us, must be of some other righteousnesse then is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in us.</p>
                  <p>I adde onely one Text more, which speaks very strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this matter, and that is <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.24. where it is prophesied, that by the <hi>Messiah</hi> shall be brought in this two-fold benefit; First, An Expiation of sinne. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, An Everlasting Righteousnesse. I shall not spend time to confute <hi>Junius</hi> his Exposition, who understands these two things not as Benefits procured by Christ, but as duties imposed upon the Jews in their conversion, to expiate sinne by repentance, and by faith to lay hold on this righteousnesse which is everlasting. Therefore to passe that by.</p>
                  <p>Here first we see, That remission of sin is not all the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse that Christ brings in.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the righteousnesse which a believer hath, is by Christ: So that as its not the beleevers tears that wash away his sinnes, but Christs bloud; so neither is it the beleevers duties or graces, that make him in this sense righteous, but what Christ did for us. Therefore its a righteousnesse that Christ brings in. As there was no remission of sinne, but that which Christ brought in; So no righteousnesse which he doth not also bring in, and this is called everlasting righteousnesse, because though imputed righteousnesse, shall cease in heaven, yet the praise and glory of all shall be in reference to that: Even as Christ, though he will perfectly sanctifie us in Heaven, yet shall not loose the honour and glory of that Mediatorship, which once he accomplished on earth.</p>

This we urge for his active obedience also, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. Christ is there made a Surety. This seemeth to carry more in it then a Saviour or Redeemer; for by this Suretiship he becometh in our stead, and so is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form for us what we ought to do; <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against Suretiship amongst men, he that keepeth off from it is sure, and yet there the danger is only in being liable to pecuniary debts and outward misery: But oh the great love and condescension of Christ, who would become Surety for us, so as to die for us, to endure the wrath of God for us, and to fulfill all those acts of obedience in a servile and deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed way, as he did! If then we would know whether Christs active obedience be imputed to us, let us consider what we were bound to do, and yet could never be able to perform, and then what it did behove our Surety to do for us.</p>

                  <p>THe Argument in hand, to prove the imputation of Christs active obedience, is taken <hi>from the Office and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation Christ hath put himself into for us, and that is, to be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and a Surety.</hi> Christ is called our Mediator often, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. but he is called a <hi>Surety</hi> once only, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. The <hi>Socinian</hi> cavilleth at the word Mediator, and would not understand thereby a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of reconciliation by way of atonement, but an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or a bare Messenger declaring the will of God;</hi> But the contexts where Christ is so called do evidence more then so, howsoever the word <hi>Surety</hi> that will constringe the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique that he cannot evade; For a <hi>Surety</hi> (properly so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) is one that receiveth the obligation upon himself, when the principal or debtor is notable to pay <hi>(Silvest Sum. Tit. fideiussum)</hi> So that whatsoever the debt is, that the <hi>Surety</hi> ingaged is bound to perform; Christ then being our <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> all that obligation which lay upon us, is derived to him.</p>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:118921:203"/>
                  <p>Now first, this is plain, That Christ would fulfill all that righteousnesse which did belong to him; otherwise he would have been an imperfect Surety; for as those who are arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God in their own persons, shall not go out of prison till they have paid the last farthing; so neither would the justice of God set Christ at liberty, till every farthing of our debt was discharged. Hence <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.15. when <hi>John</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptist refused to baptize Christ, he saith, <hi>Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousnesse. It becometh us]</hi> that is, <hi>John</hi> in his office, and Christ in his office, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved Christ in his way to fulfill all that righteousnesse that did belong to a Christ to do, as it doth to any man in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular relation: Now in the Text we see, that submitting himself to Baptism, it was part of the righteousnesse which he did fulfill, as also to be circumcised, to have an offering for him, as for others; here we may justly wonder, why Christ should be baptized, seeing that Baptism in the proper nature of it, signifieth remission of sinnes, the Seal of which could not belong unto Christ? Many give several reasons of it, which seem to be very remote; That which appeareth to be most genuine is, That Baptism, though it doth in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar seal the pardon of sinne, yet in the general its only <hi>obsig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native</hi> of the favour of God to us, and our communion with him, therefore ordinarily said to be the seal of the Covenant of Grace, and in this signification Christ might well submit to it. But why is it called righteousnesse in Christ to do it? I do not with <hi>Grotius</hi> take righteousnesse here for condecency and fitnesse; but truly and properly righteousnesse, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fulfilling of his duty, he being now made man, and so under the Law for us, for although it be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, yet that doth many times signifie a necessary duty, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. and it must be so here, because the Baptism of <hi>John</hi> was instituted by God, and as it was not a meer condecency, but a duty in <hi>John</hi> to administer; so also it was in Christ, who subjected himself to be a member of the Church, and thereby was obliged to be baptized, as others were. Hence <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.31. the neglect of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism is called <hi>The rejection of the council or command of God.</hi> From this particular then
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:118921:203"/> I gather, That whatsoever righteousnesse did lie upon Christ to fulfill, <hi>That it behoved him to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore in the second place, <hi>Let us take notice of what righteousnesse he was obliged unto by being our Surety.</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That he was bound to make an atonement by his death for us, is acknowledged by all the Orthodox.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Socinian</hi> makes it not only an absurd thing, but abhorrent from all reason, that an innocent man should suffer death for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and be provoketh to the light of nature, and Heathens in this point. Its true, this is a Question disputed in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law, Whether an innocent man may suffer corporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for another. <hi>Covarruvias</hi> a man of great learning and various reading, doth pithily but shortly handle it. [<hi>Covarr. Nariar. resolut. Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.] Its confessed by all, That a man though innocent may willingly give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to suffer for another in pecuniary punishments, and such outward losses. Its also granted, That God may punish those that are innocent at least, not nocent, for the sinnes of those that are nocent. Not to speak of Gods Law, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the beast to be killed that was instrumental to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, though the beast was not guilty of sinne. Thus that learned Authour instanceth out of <hi>Budeus,</hi> who hath it out of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> that even animate and inanimate creatures that had been instrumental to a mans death, were formerly by the <hi>Athenians</hi> indited and condemned by <hi>Dracoes</hi> Laws. Not to speak of this (I say) its plain by Scripture, that God threatens <hi>to visit the sinnes of Parents upon their children, even to the fourth generation.</hi> How this is consistent with <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18.18, 19. is not my work here to examine. Its enough for my purpose, that God saith, <hi>he will punish parents sinnes upon their children;</hi> and we see he did it in <hi>Dathans</hi> and <hi>Abirams</hi> case, as also in the children of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans</hi> case, and <hi>Sauls</hi> seven sonnes, who were hanged for their fathers wickednesse. Neither can it be limited, as some would, that God punisheth parents sinnes upon the children, when they imitate their fathers in their wickednesse, for the instances mentioned shew the clean contrary. And besides,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:118921:204"/> it would not then have been said for their fathers sinnes, but their own. Thus the people of whom <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>These sheep, what have they done?</hi> were punished for <hi>Davids</hi> sinne. Now although even Infants and others that were thus puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, were not absolutely innocent, but had corruption in them, for which they deserved any punishment God should inflict on them; yet as to this particular of their fathers sins they were innocent. So that its granted by all, That God may inflict misery upon him that is innocent, and this must be granted by the <hi>Socinian,</hi> unlesse he will deny Scripture, That Christ, though innocent, yet was greatly afflicted, dying an ignominious and reproachfull death; onely they make Christs sufferings for a lesse matter, then we do; We say, It was to satisfie the justice of God; they onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Doctrine, which miracles could have done as well: So that its not our Doctrine but theirs, that makes God put Christ to those bitter agonies, and that needlesly, or for little cause at all.</p>
                  <p>Being thus cleared by Scripture, what God may do, we need not care what mans reason can object; and indeed it must be granted, That by the civil Law, no man can lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that is innocent, submit himself to die in the stead of the nocent; he may suffer losse of money, and such kinde of damages he may sustain, but not to be mutilated in members, or to lose life. Therefore though the stories of Heathens do speak much of such things, yet its hard to justifie them; no, not that of <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> in putting out one of his eyes, for the reason given by <hi>Casuists</hi> is, because no man is Lord or Master of his own life, or his own members, and therefore cannot by voluntary consent deprive himself of them for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; But this doth not hold in Christs case, for <hi>John</hi> 10. he saith, <hi>He had</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>right and power to lay down his life;</hi> he was Lord of his life, and so could give it up as an expiatory atonement for us, and therefore being our Surety he was bound unto it. Thus its clear for his passive obedience. And</p>
                  <p>In the second place, <hi>By the same principles and reasons, its no lesse clear for his active obedience.</hi> Therefore <hi>Grotius</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to acknowledge, <hi>That Christs satisfaction was by the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:118921:204"/> holy actions he did, as well as by his sufferings,</hi> and brings this Text, <hi>By the obedience of one many shall be made righteous. [De Satisfac. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 97.] And certainly its no more against reason, That the vertue or obedience of another should be imputed unto us, then his sufferings. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we had an obligation upon us to bring perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, it behoved our Surety to perform it for us; neither can it be rationally imagined, why his impletive obedience of the commands of the Law should be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed with then the solutive of the punishment of it. Now the debtor or principal failing, not onely in satisfaction to the punishment, but perfect obedience to the Law, it behoveth our Surety, if he will fulfil all righteousnes, to accomplish both for us, &amp; as to suffer in our stead, so to obey in our stead: otherw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se we take but an half Christ, and he loseth much of his honour, and we much of our comfort. Its therefore our duty to look upon Christ doing as well as suffering, not to oppose or sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate these from one another: And certainly as <hi>Bonaventure</hi> said, about the controversie concerning free-will and grace, <hi>Tutius erratur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Its safe to erre (if we must erre) by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving too much to grace, then too little:</hi> So its lesse danger, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture propounds Christ to be such a rich and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Saviour to give too much to him, then too little. We had better be found maintaining this, that Christ did more for us then he did, then affirming him to do lesse for us then he did. Though indeed we are not willingly to run into any errour, for the genuine effect of that cannot be to the praise and honour of God.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, <hi>To understand better how much Christ is obliged for us as a Surety, its good to take notice, That there passed a kinde of Covenant and Agreement between the Father and the Sonne concerning our Redemption.</hi> I do not speak of the Covenant of Grace, which God made with man fallen, I cannot by any means subscribe to their opinion, who hold this was made with Christ, but of a particular Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Christ to be the Mediatour; for thus the Scripture represents the Father stipulating and agreeing with the Sonne, that if he will lay down his life for such, and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:118921:205"/> will become their Surety, to make up all the breaches that their sinnes have made, then <hi>he shall see of the travail of his soul, and he shall be satisfied,</hi> Isa. 53.10, 11. so <hi>Psalm.</hi> 40.7. Christ is there brought in as a Surety, offering himself for us, and readily accepting of Gods will in this matter. We see then the Father enjoyning or requiring, and the Sonne accepting of this work, and upon this he is called <hi>Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and his <hi>ears</hi> are said to be <hi>opened.</hi> Hence <hi>Isai.</hi> 42.1, 6. <hi>Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my elect in whom my soul delighteth; I will give thee for a Covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;</hi> yea this agreement seemeth to be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with an oath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.28. and for this service Christ is required, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.8. To <hi>ask of God, and he will give him the Heathen for his inheritance:</hi> So that the Church of God is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Christ, as a reward of that obedience, which he shewed in accepting of the Office of a Surety for us. This stipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made by a learned man to be that councel of peace, <hi>Zec.</hi> 6.13. which is said to be <hi>between the Lord, and the man whose name is the Branch.</hi> Though others by both do understand <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi> And for this agreement it is, that Christ is called the second <hi>Adam;</hi> for as with the first <hi>Adam</hi> God plighted a Covenant concerning him and his posterity, if he did not fall; So also did he indent with Christ and his seed concerning eternal life to be obtained by him. Its true, there are men that speak very contemptibly of both these Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, making the former at least, if not the later, to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and absurd, as if it were no better then that <hi>Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio de Hippocentauro,</hi> spoken of in the civil Law <hi>[Covar.]</hi> But I suppose such a Covenant hath sufficiently been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated out of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place, <hi>Such an agreement and stipulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made between the Father and the Sonne, our sinnes are laid upon him, and his obedience and sufferings are made ours; so that in this controversie we are to look upon Christ in the nearest, but spiritual union that can be.</hi> Its not enough to say, Christ is the cause of our righteousnesse, but he is made our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, Christ received by faith is the matter of our Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical righteousnesse; so that Christ doth otherwise procure
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:118921:205"/> our righteousnesse whereby we are justified, then he doth the grace of our inward Vocation and Regeneration, for he is not the matter of that: we cannot say, Christ received by faith is the matter of our Vocation and Regeneration, as we may say he is of our Justification. The Father works holi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse in us, the Spirit worketh holinesse in us, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, These are made righteousnesse to us, whereby we are justified, because neither of them did interpose to be a Surety for us; Hence by reason of this Union, Christ cals the sinnes of those whom he is to redeem, his sinnes, <hi>Psalm</hi> 40.12. Its Christ that speaks there, though it was also true of <hi>David</hi> as the type in another sense, <hi>Mine iniquities have taken hold on me;</hi> our iniquities are called Christs iniquities; Therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. Christ is there said to come a second time without sinne, implying his first coming was with sinne, not indeed inhering in him, but imputed to him, so that he was to bear them away. Thus his righteousnesse and obedience is made ours, and both his obedience and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were not onely for us, but in our stead he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished all, as undertaking our obligation upon him.</p>
                  <p>Yet in the fifth place, <hi>We must thus understand the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Christs obedience to us in those things onely wherein we were obliged.</hi> We cannot say, That many things Christ did, are our obedience, and are imputed to us. The miracles that Christ wrought, though they were for our good, yet they were not imputed to us as our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and the reason is, because we had no obligation upon us to these things, and therefore Christ acted as our Surety in those things onely wherein we were obliged, whatsoever other things he might do as God, or occasionally as man, or as a Mediatour; These things though they had their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and proper benefit accrewing to us, yet we cannot say, Christ did them as in our stead: Even as with <hi>Adam,</hi> it was not every personal action that he did, that was imputed to us, we did not eat or drink in <hi>Adam,</hi> as we sinned in him, but that onely in which the Covenant consisted. And thus have we finished the <hi>fifth Argument:</hi> we were the larger upon
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:118921:206"/> it, because this is the foundation of all, and all the other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are at last to be reduced to this, this giveth life and strength to all the rest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> The <hi>sixth Argument shall be taken from the perpetuity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of the Law:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Argument from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity and immutability of the Law.</note>
                     <hi>God will not give eternal life, but upon a</hi> Do this. <hi>This righteousnesse will be for ever required, as the condition of happinesse,</hi> Levit. 18.5. Ezek. 20.11. Mat. 5.18. <hi>and whereas it might be thought by the Apostles Arguments, that he did overthrow the Law, he disclaimeth such inferences,</hi> Rom. 3.31. <hi>Yea</hi> (saith he) <hi>we establish the Law,</hi> the righteousness of faith doth not dissolve that. These places prove the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of the Law, both in the preceptive part of it, it doth and will require perfect obedience, as also in regard of the promise of eternal life: Insomuch that learned and great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors say, <hi>[Beza, Junius, Perkins.]</hi> That we may claim eternal life, <hi>ex formulâ foederis, Hoc fac &amp; vives,</hi> Do this and live; but I see no necessity of granting that, because the Law required it in our persons, and so it is not our doing, but Christs doing for us by which we live: Its the same righteousnesse we and <hi>Adam</hi> in his state of Integrity are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by, in respect of the nature and substance of it, onely the manner of communication of it is different, in <hi>Adam</hi> it was inherent, in us it is imputed: Therefore the <hi>Leyden</hi> Divines do well observe, <hi>[Synop. puri. Theol. de Justificat.]</hi> That the righteousnesse of faith, or the righteousnesse of the Gospel and the Law, are not absolutely and simply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to another; we are not justified contrary to the Law, onely in respect of us, there is such an opposition, that he who is justified by one cannot be by the other, not that they are two distinct righteousnesses every way, but two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite wayes of communicating the same righteousnesse, that righteousnesse we formerly had in us, is now in Christ our Surety, and we by faith are made partakers of it; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its wholly a mistake to think, that the Apostle argueth against Justification by works, or righteousnesse by the Law, as fulfilled by Christ for us, for his purpose is to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish it so, onely he bends himself against those that sought for this righteousnesse of the Law in themselves, whether
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:118921:206"/> without the grace of God, or with it. The Apostle then doth not absolutely and universally argue against the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of the Law, but the endeavouring to finde this in our selves, and not in Christ. And indeed this must be so, because the primary work of Christ our Surety was, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that obedience of the Law we were obliged unto; and secondarily to remove our punishment, which was due to us by the transgression of the Law: So that if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the stipulation that Christ made with the Father to be our Surety, his active obedience was the main and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal: Even as all Law-givers regard more the obedience of their Laws, then Satisfaction to the penalty; and indeed if we duly consider it, God himself cannot take off the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from us, no more then he can cease to be our God and Creator; for obedience is founded necessarily in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of a creature unto its Creator.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>seventh Argument</hi> may be <hi>from the typical prefigurations <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>7</label> of their active obedience by Christ.</hi> Indeed there is a later Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>[Forbes]</hi> that useth this Argument the contrary way, <hi>We are not</hi> (saith he) <hi>justified by the Active obedience of Christ, but the Passive onely, because all the legal Types were of that onely.</hi> But I urge on the contrary, There were prefigurative Types of his Active obedience; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that concurreth to our Justification. Although there is no strength in that Argument, to say, Such things were not in Christ, because there was no Type of it; but we need not runne to that in <hi>Exodus</hi> 28.36, 38. we there reade plainly of the pure gold that was to be on <hi>Aaron,</hi> with this engraven on it, <hi>HOLINESSE TO THE LORD,</hi> and this was, That the children of <hi>Israel</hi> might be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted of in all their holy things: the pure and excellent Garments of the High-Priest, as also his Washings and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications did manifest this; yea in the Lamb that was sacrificed there was required, that it should be without spot and blemish, which integrity was considered as part of the Sacrifice; and this the Apostle considereth as part in Christs Sacrifice, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.19. <hi>The precious bloud of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot. The
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:118921:207"/> precious bloud of Christ</hi>] there is his Passive obedience; <hi>Without spot or blemish</hi>] there is his Active.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> Lastly, <hi>The Doctrine which holds the imputation of both Obedience active and Passive, tends more to Christs honour and our comfort.</hi> Its true, we must not honour Christ, or take comfort upon feigned opinions of our own; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we argue, This (we think) honours Christ, and will bring comfort: Therefore its true; But when we see the scope of the Scripture is to exalt Christ, not in his own Person so much, as our Mediatour, and to commend his love, by how much the more he was debased for us; As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, to comfort us by the proper fulnesse that is in him, for every want and temptation we have, then finding many particular Texts subservient to that generall scope, we may with the more confidence and comfort assert the latitude of all his obedience for us: For the Scripture doth not onely speak of Grace, but riches of Grace, and superabounding Grace by him, and that he became poor that we might be rich; so that they extenuate it, who
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:118921:207"/> limit it onely to a Satisfaction of the penalty of the Law, and will not admit an obediential righteousnesse to the commands of it. Certainly, the temptation of a godly man doth not onely lie about the pardon of his sinne, but the defect and imperfection of his obedience. Therefore <hi>Beza</hi> (in his <hi>Confessio Fidei, cap.</hi> 28.) amongst other strong temptations of Satan, whereby he assaults the godly, makes this one, That we have not in us the righteousnesse which God justly requireth of us. Its not enough to have satisfied for sinne, but God also requireth perfect obedience. Now in this temptation, he directs the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the other treasure of Christ, beside Satisfaction, which is his most absolute and perfect righteousnesse, which by Faith applied, we are in Christ accepted of, as co-heirs with him. Hence also he saith, <hi>Pag.</hi> 63. The Law and the Gospel differ not in respect of that righteousnesse we are to be cloathed with, if we would have eternal life, but only in the manner of participation of it.</p>

And the first shall be that which they judge palmarious, and the chiefest of their Scripture-Arguments, and that is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The contrary Arguments examined.</note>
                     <hi>The Scripture attributing our Justification every where to the bloud of Christ, it makes our redemption to be by his death onely.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> So <hi>Piscator</hi> argueth, (2. <hi>Vol. Thes. de Justif.</hi>) The Scripture
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:118921:208"/> attributeth our remission of sinne and salvation, onely to Christs death, therefore onely by it are we justified. To this we may reduce <hi>Forbes</hi> his Argument, concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Baptism, and especially of the Lords Supper, that they represent onely the passive obedience of Christ, and these being in their Institution the seals of the righteousnesse of faith, must necessarily inferre, that our righteousnesse is only by Christs sufferings.</p>
                  <p>Now although we have formerly answered sufficiently to this, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> as it was an Argument brought to limit the obedience mentioned in the Text, only to passive obedience, yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more is to be replied to it, because they put so much confidence in it. And</p>
                  <p>First, They put the word <hi>Sola</hi> in the Argument, which the Scripture doth not; They say, by Christs passive obedience alone, but the Scripture useth no such limiting or exclusive particle. If our Protestant Writers had not upon better ground said, <hi>Solâ fide,</hi> by faith alone we are justified, they would have been justly obnoxious to the Popish censure. When therefore the Scripture doth so often mention Christs death, this is not to be understood exclusively to his antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous obedience, but synecdochically, by a chief part of it intending the whole; for as we formerly shewed, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture attributes it sometimes to other things, especially <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. there is the whole course of his obedience from his birth to his death, mentioned as the ground of our salvation; and to these former places, I shall adde all such Texts, as make the whole person, even Christ himself the ground of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, not restraining the person to his sufferings, but making the whole person to be the matter or object of our acceptance with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God set forth to be a propitiation.</hi> So 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, and Christ was made sinne for us.</hi> John 1. <hi>As many as received him;</hi> and in many places, Christ speaks of himself in his whole person, that he is <hi>life,</hi> that he is <hi>the bread of life, That he who believeth in him shall never die:</hi> So that to speak properly, not the death of Christ, but Christ himself is the object of our Justification: Neither are we
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:118921:209"/> to seek it either in his active, or in his passive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by dividing or distinguishing of them, but in Christ himself.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Even the Adversaries must acknowledge from their own principles, that by death we are to mean other things besides that, for otherwise his sufferings before in the Garden would be excluded, wherein Christ seemed to be more afflicted then in death it self, as also the sufferings of his soul under the sense of Gods anger, which yet many of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents acknowledge; yea there are those that confesse all the servile acts of Christs obedience to be part of his satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory righteousnesse; and if death be not understood synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochically, they must be all excluded; it is therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that we must look upon Christs death, not as opposite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his former acts of obedience, but because this was the ultimate and most signal expression of it, therefore doth the Scripture so often mention it.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Sacraments, though they may visibly in a more peculiar manner represent Christ as suffering for us, yet most Divines say, That our communion sealed in them, is not properly with those actions of Christ, but Christ himself: So that in every Sacrament, its Christ himself we put on, and its Christ himself that we are more ingraffed into: Hence <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15. Christ dying on the Crosse is resembled to the Serpent lifted up, <hi>and whosoever believeth in him shall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, but have everlasting life.</hi> Thus the eating of his flesh and drinking of his bloud sacramentally, is nothing but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving in him, and receiving whole Christ primarily, and all his benefits flowing from him by consequence. Its therefore a great mistake to oppose Christs death to his active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for Christs sufferings, meerly as so, do not make an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for us, but as they were the effects of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and of his love to God and man; Therefore we are to look on Christs death, as an obediential act, which was the consummation of all his former obedience, yea if we tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly search to the root of the matter, it was not so much his external sufferings, as the inward promptitude of his will to die for us, that was meritorious, and this will he had as
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:118921:209"/> soon as he came into the world. Therefore that very place so much insisted on by the opponents, is a pregnant instance against them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>By the which will we are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus once for all;</hi> because that <hi>[once]</hi> is not spoken determinatively, as if then, and onely then our consummation of happinesse was attained, but its expressed oppositely to the frequent repetition of the Sacrifices in the Old Testament: and that we are not to restrain this blessednesse of ours to the time of his death, appeareth <hi>vers.</hi> 5. <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for me— Lo I come to do thy will (O God.)</hi> By this its plain we are not to look so much to Christs death, as his will to die, for that external act had no merit in it, simply as so, without Christs will; and Christs will is not to be considered as immediate before his death, but as soon as ever he came into the world. And although we are not curiously to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire when began the time of Christs meriting for us, yet we see by that expression (when he cometh into the world, even then it is, <hi>to do thy will, O God</hi>) that this must needs be very early, and by this will which he had as soon as he came into the world, we are said to be sanctified; and therefore as <hi>Suarez</hi> (though a Jesuite) yet speaks more soundly in this particular, then many others who pretend to greater Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy, when out of <hi>Aquinas</hi> he sheweth, That by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and appointment of God its brought about, that the whole life of Christ should be ordained for the obtaining of a full right, as it were of one merit to be consummated in his death. (<hi>Suarez De Christo Quaest.</hi> 19. <hi>Disp.</hi> 39.) So that our proper duty is not to divide his active or passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or to attribute his holinesse to one end, and his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to another, but to look upon his whole life and death, as that full and integrall righteousnesse, whereby we stand justified before God. And thus much for the first Objection.</p>
                  <p>The second Argument brought against the imputation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Christs active obedience in the sense controverted, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>
                     </label> is taken <hi>from the debt and obligation that lay upon Christ in respect of his
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:118921:210"/> humane nature to obey the Moral Law of God.</hi> From whence they argue, <hi>That which Christ was bound to do for himself, that cannot be imputed to us for our righteeusnesse, but Christ in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his humane nature was bound to obey the Moral Law for himself: Therefore it cannot be imputed to us. Even</hi> (say they) <hi>as if Christ had been bound to suffer for himself, his sufferings could not have been a Propitiatory Atonement for us. This is one of the principal Arguments insisted on: Christ as a man, and as a member of the Jewish Church was obliged to an actual confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in obedience to them, and therefore it was not for us, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he did so obey.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> This Argument deserveth a large discussion, for a great part of the cause will be gained if this be cleared. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are Divines of very great name, that do whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny that Christ was bound to the Moral Law, because though his humane Nature was a creature, yet because the personal subsistence of it was Divine, and Laws being given not to Natures, but to Persons, therefore it was that he was not bound to obey any Law; and indeed it must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the whole order of nature was inverted in Christ: Every thing in him was a miracle, he was a Lord of the Law, and yet obedient to it, he was both a <hi>Viator</hi> and a <hi>Comprehensor:</hi> so that its no wonder if those things which are easily granted of pure meer men be denied of Christ, who though man, yet had a Divine Subsistency. But whether this hypostatical Union did absolutely free him from an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the Moral Law, I much doubt, for still his humane nature did abide a creature, and the will of a creature cannot be the supream Law, therfore it had an obligation upon it, and if this be not so, it will be hard to say, how Christ could obey, for <hi>actiones</hi> are <hi>suppositorum</hi> also, actions are of persons proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not of natures, and so by this means we shall make it impossible for Christ to be our Redeemer and Surety. We must therefore necessarily conclude that Christ was obliged to keep the Moral Law, not indeed as God, nor in respect of his personal Subsistence, but as man; For its an undeniable Rule, amongst the learned, <hi>that what doth belong to either of the Natures of Christ, is yet attributed to the whole
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:118921:210"/> person, by</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the communication of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi> So that as Christ himself said of himself, while on earth, <hi>John</hi> 3.13. <hi>That the Sonne of man is in Heaven;</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. God is said <hi>to purchase the Church by his own blood,</hi> which expressions are true by the communication of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: So also its true, when we say, Christ was bound to keep the Moral Law, that is, in respect of his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Neither is it necessary to put in that limitation alwayes (as a man) in our speeches, for we see the Scripture speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so often of Christ, without limiting either to his humane or divine Nature, because common reason will make us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, in respect of which nature it is, that such a thing is affirmed of him; Therefore let us grant, that Christ as man was bound to obey a Law.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, <hi>Let us consider what Law he was obliged unto.</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>There is that which is called by some, the Eternal Law, or Law of Nature, whereby things intrinsecally good are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and intrinsecally evil are prohibited; such are, to love God, not to lie,</hi> &amp;c. Now even to this Law say some eminent Divines, Christ was not bound, because the hypostatical Union did exempt him, for this they think as absurd, as if a man should say, Christ was subject to himself, or Christ was bound to obey himself. Therefore though they will grant, That Christ could not lie, could not but love God, yet this did not arise from an obligation of any Law he was under, but from the perfection of his Nature: Even as God himself cannot sinne, not because he is under a Law, seeing his Will is the Rule of all goodnesse, but because of the infinite holinesse which is in him. But I cannot subscribe to this, because (as was said before) the personal Union doth not exempt the humane Nature of Christ from being a creature, neither doth he cease to be man; And therefore seeing his humane Will was not the supream Rule of holinesse, its necessary it should be conformed to that which was supream: Hence he said, <hi>Not my will, but thine be done;</hi> and although it be true, that its the person that is the principle of actions, and to whom Laws are made, yet mediately they extend to Natures also.
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:118921:211"/> The person or <hi>suppositum</hi> is the <hi>principium quod,</hi> the principle that doth act, but the Natures in Christ, are the <hi>principium quo,</hi> the principle by which the person doth work. So that I shall not deny, but that Christ as a man was obliged to this Law, yet there is no consequence at all, that therefore this obedience of his may not be imputed to us.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, there is the civil or political Law, under which I comprehend the command of obedience to parents, though that also may be called natural, and so it is in respect of meer man, but I think it was positive onely in respect of Christ; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>
                     </label> and here the Question is, Whether Christ was bound to obey these Laws? Onely take notice (as is more to be shewed) that an obligation may arise two wayes:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> 1. From the nature of the thing antecedently to a mans consent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From supposition only, supposing a former consent to such and such a condition, then he having ingaged thereunto, by that means he hath induced an obligation upon himself, as between man and man: Though a friend be not bound to be Surety for another, or to pay his debts, yet if once he hath undertaken it, then he is obliged, not from any intrinsecal cause, but by an extrinsecal supposition.</p>
                  <p>To apply this to our purpose, when we question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ was bound to obey the mentioned Laws? We speak not of an obligation by supposition; for when he had once voluntarily made himself under such a Law, then he was bound thereby; but of an intrinsecal obligation arising from the nature of the thing, Whether Christ was bound to obey his Parents, or the civil Magistrate, as other men are? or, Whether the obedience he did shew was onely voluntary, and for our example, and concerning his subjection to his Mother <hi>Mary?</hi> Certainly, even in that Law of honouring Parents there was a great difference between Christ and a meer man; Therefore we reade, when his Mother (<hi>John</hi> 3.3.) told him, <hi>they had no wine,</hi> that Jesus said to her, <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> (not mother) <hi>What have I to do with thee? my hour is not yet come:</hi> So again, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.48. when his mother said, <hi>Sonne, Why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold thy father and I have
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:118921:211"/> sought thee sorrowing: he said unto them, Wist ye not that I must be about my Fathers businesse?</hi> These expressions do argue some independency in Christ, more then in a meer naturall sonne; for although <hi>Levi</hi> is commended for not knowing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother; yea in Christs cause <hi>we are to hate father and mother,</hi> yet our Saviour seemeth to insinuate more in himself then this. Its true, its said at the 51. verse, <hi>that Christ went down with his parents to Nazareth, and was subject to them;</hi> but the ground is not set down whether it was a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary subjection, or necessary from a natural obligation. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, it could not be a natural obligation, as to <hi>Joseph,</hi> who was his father only, (as it was supposed) or his legal father amongst men; and in respect of his mother, although he was born of her, and <hi>made of a woman,</hi> in respect of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily substance, yet seeing her conception was in a miraculous and extraordinary way, we cannot say, that she was his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in such a manner as ordinarily mothers are to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: This is to shew, that though Christ was subject to his Parents, yet there was not such a natural obligation upon him, as is on meer men, but it was in a great measure, though I cannot say universally voluntary, I say universally, because so farre as she was his true mother, and he her true real Son, so far the natural honouring Parents did extend to him. There is no lesse doubt about the civil Magistrate, Whether Christ as man was bound to obey him; for when they came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Tribute of him, our Saviours Argument seemeth to carry it, that he was free, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.26. a difficult place it is, that hath occasioned much debate upon it. Its granted by all, That <hi>quoad factum</hi> and <hi>usum</hi> did subject himself to the Magistrate, did pay Tribute, did not refuse to appear before their Judgement, acknowledged <hi>Pilate</hi> had power over him: But the Question is, Whether there was an obligation upon him as he was man to do thus? Or, Was it a meer volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry privation of the use of that right which he had? To this there are several Answers, which arise from severall springs; for there are those that say, Christ as man by his lineal descent had the true and proper right to the Kingdom of <hi>Judaea,</hi> that the Scepter did belong to him, as being the next successour,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:118921:212"/> onely he did voluntarily abstain from the claim and exercise of this right; so that when he was taxed with others, and paid Tribute, this he did, not as bound to it, but relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or suspending his right. But there must be many doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conjectures cleared ere this can be positively asserted. The Popish parasites upon a carnal design to advance the Pope above all civil power, say, That Christ as man had the direct and absolute dominion over all the Kingdoms and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world, and that by a three-fold title, 1. Of his personal Union. 2. By Merit. 3. By Redemption. So that by this right, Christ, if he would, might have deposed all the powers that then ruled, and have taken their priviledges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hand; he had this dominion, they say, <hi>in habitu,</hi> though he did not put it forth <hi>in actu secundo.</hi> But this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture; for Christ saith, <hi>John</hi> 20. <hi>His Kingdom is not of this world;</hi> neither was such a priviledge any wayes proper or accommodated to his Mediatory Office, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by this opinion Christ was not obliged to obey any civil Magistrate, because all temporal Jurisdiction did belong to him, as a Superiour. In the third place, <hi>Spalato (l.</hi> 6. <hi>de Repub. Eccl. cap.</hi> 1.) acknowledged to be a learned man, though in a large Discourse, he is very vehement against such fawning Positions of some Papists, yet affirmeth, That it cannot be said <hi>sine blasphemia haereticali,</hi> that Christ as man was subject to the civil power, or that <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> had any right over him even as man: The reason he proceedeth upon is, That the right of civil power doth not extend to humanities in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract, but to persons, and therefore <hi>Pilate</hi> did not only sin by unjust judgement condemning the innocent, but also by an usurped judgement, exercising jurisdiction over him, who was not over him. Its true, he will not grant <hi>Pilates</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was usurped, for he had right upon a lawfull presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, because <hi>Pilate</hi> was not bound to know that Christ was God, as well as man, or that his humane Nature did subsist in the Divine Person. But this is infirm, for <hi>Pilate</hi> being the Judge, as he was bound to know, Whether Christ was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or no, so having the opportunity and means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he was bound to have believed in him as the <hi>Messias,</hi>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:118921:212"/> Not to be too long on this, we may conclude, That Christ did truly subject himself unto civil powers, and was obliged thereunto as man, taking such a servile form upon him, as he did; onely this subjection and obedience was voluntary, in that he was not necessitated, but voluntarily took our nature upon him in such a subjected way for our everlasting good: Even as he voluntarily took a passible body, subject to thirst and wearinesse, yea pains and death it self for our sakes: So that although he might have been made man, and yet not put himself into such bodily infirmities, or moral subjection and debasement; yet when once he hath thus subjected himself, then there is an obligation upon him.</p>
                  <p>A further doubt may be made about the positive precepts, which God gave the people of the Jews, to be circumcised, and perform those ceremonial precepts God gave the people of <hi>Israel;</hi> for <hi>Piscator</hi> he saith, Christ was bound to these as being an <hi>Israelite,</hi> and so it was his duty to be circumcised, which accordingly he was in reference to his own obligation. Others that deny the active obedience of Christ in our sense, do grant, that he was not bound to these, but they were part of that Mediatory Law Christ had imposed on him.</p>

                  <p>THe Answering of this Question will be of the same affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the former. As Christ was not necessitated to be man, so neither to subject himself to that positive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yea though as man he might not have submitted himself unto it: for if this subjection did necessarily follow his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, then still Christ would be bound to such an obedience, for he doth not cease to be a man though glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in heaven. <hi>This obligation then of Christ in the daies of his flesh to be circumcised, and to observe such positive precepts as were commanded the Jews, did arise because of that voluntary resignation of himself to be made under the Law, which God should give his people, though in respect of his Divine nature he was Lord of that Law.</hi> Hence it was that he did observe the Sabbath, and although he did those things which his adversaries judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a breach of the Sabbath, yet he vindicated those
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:118921:213"/> passages, because they were the duties of charity and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity: Its true he saith, <hi>The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath, Matth.</hi> 12.8. but that may be understood because he who was the Son of man, was also God, and so there is the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of properties; or else in a general way, that <hi>the Sabbath was made for man,</hi> and therefore in cases of necessity a man was not obliged to such duties, as ordinarily are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And certainly, that our Saviour was obliged by the Law, as others were, (though also with great dissimilitude) doth appear in that he challengeth his adversaries, <hi>Which of you can accuse me of sinne, and what evil have I done?</hi> Implying, that if he had broken the Law, they might justly have accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him: He doth not at any time plead an exemption from the Law, or that it was made for meer men, but not for him who was God and man, but still acknowledgeth an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him; and although in paying of tribute he plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his freedom, that is, if absolutely considered, if it had pleased him, he might not so have debased himself; yet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing he would become man in such a way for our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, then he did voluntarily take this obligation upon him, which appeareth in that expression to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to pay, that he may give no offence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.27. which supposeth that there was an obligation upon Christ as man, not to give just offence or scandal, otherwise if Christ had stood upon his absolute exemption from all Laws, there was no cause to regard the matter of offence. Thus our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10. when the devil tempted him to such things as were unlawfull, he repels him by such arguments as are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from those duties that belong to a man. Thus Christ made that command, <hi>Thou shalt not temp: the Lord thy God,</hi> to belong to him: So <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve,</hi> Christ appropriates to himself; by which it appeareth that Christ looked upon it as his duty to worship and serve God according to those waies that God had commanded others.</p>
                  <p>But against this there are Learned men that Object, <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Christ</hi> (say they) <hi>could not, no not in respect of his humane nature, be obliged to the positive worship and ceremonial Law of the Jews, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:118921:214"/> he was not truly and properly a child of</hi> Abraham, <hi>because he was not in the loins of</hi> Abraham, <hi>as other Jews were, even as he was not in</hi> Adam; <hi>therefore though</hi> Adam <hi>was under a common Covenant for himself and his posterity, yet this Law did not bind Christ as it did all mankinde, for then Christ should have sinned in</hi> Adam, <hi>as well as the rest of mankinde. Thus it is also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of</hi> Abraham, <hi>seeing he was not contained in</hi> Abraham, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, neither was of</hi> Adam, quoad seminalem rationem, <hi>but</hi> corpulentam substantiam: <hi>Therefore it could not be, that those positive precepts should reach to Christ. And further, such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are made to those that do imply imperfection in them, for the ceremonial Law did signifie the expiation of sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now though this be very specious, yet it will not hold:</p>
                  <p>For 1. its granted even by them that Christ did actually submit himself to the observation of those positive precepts. They grant the <hi>Factum,</hi> but not the <hi>Jus,</hi> the observation, not the obligation. But their Objection will fall on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, Why should Christ submit to that, which in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of it did denote imperfection and sinne in the subject obliged?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their Arguments prove, that Christ was not obliged to put himself in such a condition that required such subjection, but when once he had resigned himself unto it, then he was bound not indeed properly for himself, but for us, as he was not made man for himself, but for us. Christ being circumcised did thereby make himself a debtor to keep the whole Law, not for himself but for us; Its true those that deny this obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Christ, say, that passage of <hi>Pauls, He that is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised becomes a debtor to keep the whole Law,</hi> is to be meant on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of meer man, not of Christ, who was not seminally in <hi>Abraham.</hi> But first, The Scripture cals Christ, <hi>the seed of Abraham;</hi> he is that seed <hi>in whom all the Nations of the earth are to be blessed.</hi> And secondly, Being a true man, though not in that ordinary propagation, he was thereby a member of the Jewish Church; even as if God had <hi>raised up children to Abraham out of stones,</hi> they would have been <hi>Abrahams</hi> children in the Scriptures sense, though not by natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation from him. Christ then being true man, yea and
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:118921:214"/>
                     <hi>ejusdem speciei</hi> with other men, in respect of his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he was obliged to such a worship of God, as was then appointed for all men, who should serve him according to his will. Hence it is that <hi>John</hi> 4. he puts himself in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Jewish members, when he saith to the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> in the plural number, <hi>we worship what we know.</hi> So that it was his duty, as man, to worship God: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we reade so often of his praying unto God, and that with so much fervency; for although he could as God do whatsoever he pleased, as appeareth by his working of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and so needed not to pray any more then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yet as man it was his duty to pray unto God; Prayer being by Divine ordination, the means by which God had decreed to bestow on him that glory he was to partake of: So that as its said, <hi>it behoved him to suffer, and then enter into glory,</hi> Luke 22. thus it behoved him to pray, and so receive that exaltation of his person. Hence <hi>Psal.</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. its said, <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the inheritance of the earth.</hi> He was bound to ask and seek for it by praier at Gods hands; and <hi>John</hi> 17. he doth there make a large prayer, which is for to accomplish and effect all those things either for himself or his Church, that he had merited at Gods hands. By all this it appeareth, that Christ having once subjected himself in this way as he did, there was an obligation upon him to conform himself unto those positive precepts, and that he did observe those commands not meerly for example, but from obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and duty as he was a man in that debased way.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The next and last thing to be debated about the Laws Christ was obedient unto, is,<note place="margin">Whether Christs obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was to a peculiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</note>
                     <hi>Whether there was a peculiar Law or Commandment laid upon him to be our redeemer and to die for us.</hi> And to this we have formerly answered, that Christ was truly and strictly under a command, and that what he did was properly and truly called obedience. We shewed many places, wherein Christ himself called it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not a meer bare insinuation of Gods will, but a strict command, and indeed otherwise it could not have been obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, unless <hi>materialiter,</hi> as its said, the glorified Saints in heaven do, to whom properly no command is made; they
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:118921:215"/> being now no longer <hi>viatores,</hi> or travellers to heaven, but at their journeys end; and so <hi>comprehensores</hi> of that Crown of glory laid up for them: So that although they love God and delight in him, yet (say some) this is obedience <hi>materiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> not <hi>formaliter.</hi> But that Christs obedience was formally so, appeareth, in that otherwise he could not have merited, neither could he have been our Surety to take our obligation upon him.</p>
                  <p>This then being granted, there is a further and a more difficult Question arising from the former,<note place="margin">Whether Christs obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to die for us was to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive command.</note>
                     <hi>viz. Whether Christs obedience in dying for us, was to a natural or a positive command:</hi> That is, Whether Christ in undertaking our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, was bound by a meer voluntary positive precept, such as God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his son <hi>Isaac:</hi> or whether it was from that moral Law, to love God with all his heart and soul, and his neighbour as himself. There are Learned men that say, Christ being once made man, he was bound as a man from love to Gods glory, and to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to lay down his life for mans salvation: And this they think will hold the more firmly, if we suppose it revealed to the humane nature by the Father, that he will not save man any other way. Then say they, as it is a mans duty in some cases to lay down his bodily life to save the spiritual life of another, and the Apostle saith, <hi>we are to lay down our life for the Brethren,</hi> 1 John 3.16. so it was Christs duty as man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other could do it but he, and he was only qualified for it by his debasing of himself both in life and death to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our salvation. Neither is that thought any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objection, though it be a duty to a meer man, because the salvation of anothers soul is a greater good then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily life of another; whereas Christ temporal life being the life of him who was God also, did serve to be more worth then the salvation of all mens souls. This (I say) is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, because Christs life was not absolutely lost, it was only for a little time that his soul and body was separated, though his Deity was not from either of them. Thus these Authours think, that as in some cases the moral Law doth binde to be Martyrs, and to lose our lives for the confession
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:118921:215"/> of faith, and edification of others; so it was also a command upon Christ, that God having decreed to save man no other way, but in mercy and justice joyned together, and there being no other in the world but he that could do it so, but he who was God and man; therefore the love to Gods glory and mans good, was requiring him to become a Surety for us. Neither will this take off from the free love and grace of Christ thus in living and dying for us, because it was wholly from his meer goodness to put himself in such a condition of suffering for us, in so much that absolutely he was free to do otherwise. This obligation ariseth only from the supposition, that he will become man for us; and certainly if <hi>Moses,</hi> but especially <hi>Paul</hi> could arise to such a measure of love, as to say, he could desire to be an Anathema for the good of his brethren in the flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. no wonder if Christ did abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely submit himself to be made a curse for us, out of love to Gods glory, and the salvation of man.</p>
                  <p>But if we speak exactly and properly, we must say,<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
                     <hi>That command imposed on Christ to die for us, was reducible partly to the moral Law, and partly to a positive and special command.</hi> It was a positive and special command in this sense, because this duty of dying for mans salvation, could not be injoyned any meer man, for that could not be his duty, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally impossible for any man, though possessed with so much perfection as mans nature was capable of. And besides, it must in this sense also be positive, because it was in Gods gracious good pleasure, whether he would open a way or no for the salvation of a sinner, and whether he would accept of a Surety or not. But whatsoever is commanded by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law primarily and directly, its from its own nature intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secally good and just; and therefore said not to be just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause commanded, but commanded because just. And indeed if it were not so, all the grace of God would be evacuated that is seen in our Redemption: For then God should neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily will, That Christ should be our Redeemer, and Christ also be necessitated to undertake this Office upon him; so that so farre that here is a particular way commanded, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our salvation is to be accomplished, this is altogether po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive.
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:118921:216"/> But in the second place, If we do regard the root and fountain from whence Christ as man, was thus willing to be subjected to this command, that must needs arise from the moral Law; for seeing the Law doth require even of Christ as man, to love God and man perfectly; hence we may say that <hi>eminenter</hi> and <hi>virtualiter,</hi> though not <hi>forma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ter</hi> it was required by the moral Law. It was by a special command that there should be such a way injoyned to demonstrate Christs love; yea it was a way ordained by the infinite wisdom and goodness of God: it was wholly supernatural both in the institution and revelation of it; yet when that way was made known to Christ as man and imposed on him, it was from the moral Law he submitted to it; the moral Law in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral commanding this, <hi>that whatsoever God shall require or appoint as an instance to demonstrate love to him, that we are bound to do:</hi> So that it is here in this respect, as in the Command, <hi>Thou shalt do no murder,</hi> &amp;c. This Law did oblige <hi>Adam,</hi> though while in the state of integrity there could be no object about which such a prohibition could be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant. But when through sin, such temptations are, then the moral Law is put forth into actual exercise: So that it is very great weakness to say, Christ was not bound to die for us, no nor any to be Martyrs by the moral Law, because that was given to man in integrity, for the command doth oblige, not only to what was then, but also to what new occasions or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects shall rise afterwards. Thus by the moral L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w we are commanded to love our enemies, to believe in Jesus Christ; for though these objects were not in the state of Integrity, yet when they shall be propounded, they are commanded by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that old Law. Hence our Divines do well demonstrate against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that Christ injoyned no new moral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, only did interpret the Law in a more spiritual and large extension, then the Pharisees had done. Thus we may say of that personal command to the young man, to sell all he had, though it was in respect of the matter, special and personal, yet in respect of the original and root, it was from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, which requireth us to love God with all our strength. Its true, the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.16. doth press
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:118921:216"/> the duty of laying down our lives for the Brethren, because of Christs doing so for us, which is a new motive that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law strictly taken, did not know: but its ordinary in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to press an old duty, from some new and special conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Thus they are commanded to have one God for their God, because he brought them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> This holds also in that exploratory command to <hi>Abraham</hi> about killing his son, it was special and positive in respect of the matter comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet when once commanded, it was from the moral Law he should obey. Thus it is also in Christs dying for us, the matter and the way was wholly of free-grace; but when once determined and appointed by God, that this way and no other way he would have man saved, and it being supposed that Christ would become man for us, then that command of love did rule in Christs heart: and therefore <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. he saith, <hi>Behold I come to do thy will. Thy Law is within my heart.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it follow from hence that Christ as man was bound absolutely to will and procure the salvation of all men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his humane will was directed and circumscribed by the Divine. Thus we have at large discussed this noble point, that hath so much influence into this Controversie, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christs subjection to a Law, wherein I have closed with those that do hold <hi>Christ as man was subjected to a Law.</hi> And therefore do wonder at those, though great Pillars that will answer the Argument proposed, and put all upon this issue, That Christ was not bound to obey any Law, and therefore what he did way of obedience it was wholly for us, not that any obligation lay upon him.</p>
                  <p>Before we dismiss this Point, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                     </label> let us consider what is obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to this Doctrine: And first its said, <hi>Christ though he be a man, yet being one person, and that Divine, he could not be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to a Law any more then God himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this it is Answered, That its true that Christ, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> both in respect of his Divine nature, as also of his personality, is not bound by any Law, but in respect of his humane nature: and its an acknowledged rule in Divinity, <hi>That by reason of the communication of the properties, we may predicate that of Christs Person in the concrete, which belongs to him only because of one
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:118921:217"/> of his Natures.</hi> Thus we say Christ died, Christ suffered; certainly this is more then to say, Christ was subject to a Law, and all is true, because of his humane nature, which was the <hi>principium quo</hi> of these things.</p>

                  <p>But secondly, Commands are given primarily to persons, but secondarily and remotely to natures, and therefore though the Law did not immediatly, yet mediately it did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Christs humane nature.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> It is further objected, <hi>That Christ needed not any command, because he had a perfect inclination within to what is good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Besides to a command there is injoyned threatning, and so it would be thus, that if Christ did forsake or fail in his trust, he would be a sinner, and so guilty of condemnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     </label> But two things may be replied to this, 1. That commands were not given to Christ as they are to meer men, who need direction and quickning to their duty: Therefore such addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments of incouragement, or commination were not necessary to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be granted that even such comminations were added to the commands, yet they made no impression of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour upon Christ, who was not subject to any failing, and therefore were only to inform how much God did hate or dislike the contrary to what he commanded, not that they supposed any necessity of such spurres to Christ for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of what was imposed.</p>

                  <p>CHrist (we have heard) was truly and properly subject to a Law, and that both general, which concerneth every man, and also particular, which did relate to him as Mediator.</p>
                  <p>There is one Doubt more to be removed ere we proceed, and that is, <hi>How it could be called a command imposed on Christ to die for us, seeing that his death did depend upon the wicked and corrupt wils of other men, and he was not bound to kill himself: Therefore that seemeth not to be a command to him, the effecting whereof was to be by the wickednesse of others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is easily resolved, That the command upon Christ was to walk in such a way, and to do that work of God on earth, which he had commanded, not to shrink or flie from duty, in the accomplishing whereof the malice of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would be stirred up to put him to death, and when that hour was come, Christ would not decline it.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have been large in discussing this Answer, which many learned men give; but upon the weighing of it, it
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:118921:218"/> seemeth to be too light. Though this deep searching into the particulars of it, is very profitable to give light in the controversie.</p>
                  <p>I proceed therefore to a second Answer to the grand Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which was, <hi>That Christ being obliged to the Law for himself, could not fulfill it for us, it was paying his own debt, and so could not thereby discharge ours.</hi>

                  <p>A second Answer, which seemeth to carry more truth and solidity with it, is, That Christ, though when he assumed the humane nature, he was thereby indispensably subjected to the Law of God, yet because he did freely and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily become man, and so put himself of his own accord into a state of subjection, therefore we may absolutely and truly say, Christ was free from the Law, and this may fully satisfie the Objection. Its denied, that if we speak simply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely Christ was obliged by the Law, because this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes by supposition, and upon a meer voluntary dispen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sation; for as he was not made man for himself, so neither made under the Law for himself; he did not become man, that he might obey the Law for his own good, but all this was for us. Hence <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. <hi>To us a Sonne is born;</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel told the shepherds, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>To you is a Saviour born,</hi> therefore he had his Name <hi>Jesus,</hi> not in reference to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>but to save his people from their sinnes,</hi> Thus also <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. <hi>His being made of a woman, and made under the Law,</hi> are put together, with the final cause, why? Not for himself, but <hi>to redeem us from the curse of the Law:</hi> So that if we speak ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, we may say, Christ was not bound by the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did of his meer accord put himself into this subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and although while he is in this way of submission, he is bound to obey, yet that is but an hypothetical and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional obligation: Even as being made man he was bound to suffer for us; for although it was his meer goodnesse to undertake the Office of our Redeemer, yet when once he had taken up that will and resolution, <hi>Behold, I come to do thy will, O God,</hi> then it was necessary he should suffer for us. Therefore the Scripture puts a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> an <hi>oportet</hi> upon it, <hi>It behoved him to suffer, and so to enter into glory,</hi> Luk. 22. Then its his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:118921:218"/> to drink of this Cup, and it cannot passe away. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ was no more obliged to obey the Law for us, then to suffer for us: for it was his voluntary giving up of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to this work, only when it was once undertaken, it was necessary he should accomplish it, otherwise he would have been unfaithfull in his trust. Therefore these are unclean and unsavoury positions of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who say, <hi>Christ might have relinquished this Office of Mediatorship, he might not have delighted in the glory set before him.</hi> No, such was his holy perfection, that he had an immutable necessity, though not a natural one, to fulfill his Fathers will. Its then in this case, as the Schoolmen say about the liberty of the will, when the will hath formally determined it self to will, and doth produce such a volition, it cannot do otherwise, for the old Rule is, <hi>Quicquid est, quando est, necesse est esse:</hi> yet, they say, That act of the will is free, and the will hath not lost its liberty, though determined. Thus seeing Christ was not originally necessitated to take our nature upon him, and the Scripture attributeth it alwayes to his love, therefore it is that we may say with <hi>Calvin,</hi> he was <hi>immunis,</hi> exempt from the Law: So that although Christ was as man bound to the Law, yet there was a vast difference between him and us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ became man voluntarily, we necessarily and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently to our wils, and which is the signal difference, Christ became man, not for himself, or to have eternall life and glory by any obedience, but for us: So that we cannot distinguish of a righteousnesse which Christ had for himself meerly, and another he had for us. And this brings in the examination of some distinctions. As</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Of a legal Obedience, and a servile Obedience.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some Distinctions.</note> A le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal obedience they call that which Christ as man was bound to put forth, even his conformity to the whole Moral Law. Servile obedience they call that which Christ demonstrated in respect of that special command of his Mediatorship: For (say they) <hi>though he was bound as a creature to obey the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of God, yet he was not obliged in such a low, debased manner, both by doing and suffering to procure our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:118921:219"/>
                  <p>This distinction hath some truth in it, onely its insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and imperfect, as it is managed by the learned Authours of it to serve their opinion. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take notice, that this opinion doth not <hi>Piscatorize, For our Justification is not hereby limited to the meer death of Christ, but all that obedience he shewed in his life time, subserviently to the Law of his Mediatorship, both active and passive, do make up our compleat, satisfactory righteousnesse.</hi> So that all active obedience is not excluded, but what is supposed not to be an act of humiliation.</p>
                  <p>But first, This distinction is built upon a metaphysical ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction or notional precision of respective formalities. Its true indeed, Christ might from his very birth have been in such a condition, as the glorified Saints shall be. Its the opinion of some Schoolmen and others, that Christ would have been incarnated, though <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen, because it was such a glorious mystery, and desirable in it self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect to sinne: Onely (they say) then Christ would not have come in a passible body, and then he would not have been in a meriting way, neither would his obedience have had any penality or debasement in it. Whether this be true or no, its not material; onely we grant, That Christ might have taken our nature in a glorious and immortal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but <hi>de facto,</hi> Christ did not, yea the Scripture revealeth no other end of his coming into the world, but to be our Saviour, and makes his very Incarnation, and all that he did to be in reference to us: So that howsoever in a mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing there may be made such precisive respects, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, there was no legal act of Christs obedience, but it was servile, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. The Apostle expresseth the whole state of his humiliation, to be in the form of a servant. Its there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in vain to dispute of an absolute power, when the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power is in question. The controversie is not, Whether Christ might not have performed legal acts of obedience, that would not have been imputed unto us? But whether he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually did submit himself in that humbled manner to obey the Law for himself, or others? So that Christs legall obedience, but not poenall or servile, is an <hi>Ens in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectu;</hi>
                     <pb n="405" facs="tcp:118921:219"/> Its <hi>Rosa in hyeme,</hi> as in respect of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</p>
                  <p>If with <hi>Piscator</hi> it be said, <hi>That this legal obedience did whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to Christ himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, That it did behove him no more to be under the Law, then to be made of a woman, yet certainly he was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to be made man for his own self.</p>
                  <p>And again, There is no repugnancy, as is to be shewed, that the same obedience should be under one title due and required, and under another title or end to be wholly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and undue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This distinction then in a well-seasoned sense, may be approved of, that Christs obedience as it was poenal, was part of our righteousnesse (and <hi>de facto</hi> it was not otherwise) but not as legal; though the members of the distinction are not opposite; for legal obedience may be servile, and servile legal; servile is not here taken in the sense, as we call servile fear: Christ had no such obedience, he did not obey in a servile manner, meerly out of fear; but its called ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, because it was done by him, who was in the form and condition of a servant, and it being servile obedience in this denomination it was also legal: So that this division faileth in the known Rule of Logick; The same obedience is legal in respect of the Rule, and servile in respect of the person ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This distinction is not stood to, or any wayes improved by the Authors, or at least very inconsiderably in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of the Dispute; for when such Texts are urged, <hi>That the righteousnesse of the Law may be fulfilled in us; Christ is the end of the Law for righteousnesse,</hi> or <hi>Christ was made under the Law;</hi> They runne up not to the Sanctuary of this distinction, neither do they seem to acknowledge the imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive obedience of the Law by conformity unto it, though in an humbled manner, but mention altogether the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the penalty of it, by suffering the curse annexed to the transgression of it: So that all along the controversie, I can finde little use made of it; The passive obedience is often mentioned, but the servile active to the Law of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:118921:220"/> God is very seldome, if at all taken notice of.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This distinction will be overthrown by their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and so breedeth that in its own bowels which will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it self: for thus we may argue <hi>ad homines,</hi> Christ by his offering up of himself satisfied the penalty of the Law; the Law hath no more to accuse, and where there is no accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is an acquittance; then if so, what need was there of his active, servile obedience in the whole course of his life, What need that go to make up part of our satisfactory righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, when the other was enough, and took away the whole guilt of sinne? If satisfying of the punishment of the Law be enough, what needeth the active obedience of Christ either to the Moral, or to the Positive Laws concurre to our righteousnesse? So that this servile obedience being necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily distributed into active and passive, whatsoever Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are brought against the active obedience of Christ in the sense affirmed by us, will also militate against the sense affirmed by them: Insomuch that the truth we plead for, will quickly have the victory, if we set that opinion on one hand, which limits our righteousnesse onely to the sufferings of Christ; and that opinion on the other hand which holds Christs servile obedience to concurre also to make our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat righteousnesse. These two will necessarily conflict so long together, that a third will goe away with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, This distinction brought in by learned opponents, doth not at all contradict that truth we plead for, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is wholly impertinently brought to the state of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; For those that plead for the imputation of Christs active obedience to the Law of God, either general or spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, do grant, That this obedience was wholly servile and debased, that Christ was in a state of humiliation, and not of glorification, while he thus submitted himself: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be wondred, why its brought into this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, seeing its acknowledged by all, That Christ even while he did obey any Law of God was in the form of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, all his obedience was in a debased way, and the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he submitted himself, the greater was his love to us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:118921:220"/> though once it was vehemently disputed [<hi>Vid.</hi> Suarez. <hi>in Thom. de Incar. Christi, Quaest.</hi> 20. <hi>Dis.</hi> 44.] Whether Christ be called the servant of God the Father? yet we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there was no just ground for the denial of it, seeing that the Scripture speaks so positively therein.</p>
                  <p>A second Distinction comes to be examined, that is framed by some who appear against the truth we plead for, and that is of some affinity with the former, though with some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <hi>They distinguish of Christs legal Obedience, and his Mediatorial Obedience; His legal Obedience they call that which was given to the Law as he was man, in the same obligation as it did reach to others; His Mediatory Obedience they call that which he did as God-man in accomplishing our Redemption for us.</hi> But this distinction splits at a Rock, as well as the former.</p>
                  <p>For first, It opposeth those things which are the same; legal Obedience and Mediatorial obedience, as to our controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie are the same, onely denominated from several respects: The same obedience is Mediatory, because done by him, who is the Mediator, and the same is also legal, because confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Law of God: Even as the same works which the regenerate do, may be called the works of the Spirit, and the works of the Law; of the Spirit, because he is the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and authour of them, and of the Law, because they are commensurated to that as a Rule. So that this Distinction doth <hi>opponere componenda,</hi> It behoved our Mediator to fulfill the Law for us; and this Obedience is Mediatory, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the Person from whom it floweth; and legal, as it relates to the Rule according to which it ought to be done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As it faileth in exact distinguishing; so it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so very ambiguous, and is such a distinction that it self need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a distinction, <hi>Tacere, negare, &amp; obscurè respondere idem sunt,</hi> is a Rule in the Civil Law; for it may be called Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory obedience, formally as it comes from Christ the efficient thereof, or materially, as that which Christ did. Now its true, Christs Mediatorial Obedience is not imputed unto us for righteousnesse, formally as coming from him, for so we
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:118921:221"/> should be Mediators and Saviours, but materially, that is, what Christ did that is imputed to us, as if we had done it: So that when we say, Christs Mediatory Obedience is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us, its not the meaning, as if we were reputed of by God, as the efficients who did it, but as the subjects recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, and applied to us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This distinction proceedeth upon two false and rotten foundations, as if Christ in obeying the Law did act as a meer man, whereas <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. <hi>He was made under the Law, that he might redeem us from the curse of the Law,</hi> which could not be by his meer humane Nature, yea this would be to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow that meritorious worth which was on those actions he did for us.</p>
                  <p>And the second rotten foundation is, that the Law Christ was under when working our salvation, was not the Moral Law, or Law of works, but a particular special Law impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on him as Mediatour: Now this is clearly confuted by that fore-mentioned Text, <hi>Christ was made under the Law, that he might redeem us from the curse of the Law;</hi> but it was the curse of the Moral Law he was to redeem us from, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the Moral Law he was made under. Besides, By what Law Christ was made a curse for us, that he was under: but he was only by the Moral Law, and not that special Law of a Mediatour, made a curse for us: Therefore the Law he submitted to, was that Law which was in common with us and him. Its true, we have granted a special command to be imposed on him, <hi>viz.</hi> to be our Mediatour, which did not belong to us, or oblige us; but we also have proved, that this Law did oblige him to fulfill all that we were bound to do, whereof obedience to the Moral Law was a very great part, and of which he said, <hi>It was written in his heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, the summe of this second Answer to that grand Objection is, That Christ absolutely and universally considered, was not obliged to be under the Law, no more then to be made of a woman, or to die for us. This obligation ariseth conditionally, upon his voluntary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to such a Condition. And this (I conceive) doth clearly and fully Answer the Objection propounded, yet
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:118921:221"/> that the evidence may (if possibly) be more convincing, I shall</p>
                  <p>In the third place Answer, by way of additional explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the former, in this manner, That though Christ sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and absolutely, as man, might be obliged by the Law, yet as our Surety and undertaking for us in a <hi>fidejussorial</hi> manner, so his obligation was wholly voluntary and free; for we may conceive of Christ two wayes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As acting and obeying in his single Person.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As acting as our Surety and Undertaker. The former Condition is onely in our understanding, and imagined as possible onely; for Christ was not incarnated or made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law for himself, but for us: So that although we may conceive,</p>
                  <p>First, Christs being made man, and thereby an absolute ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to obey God for himself.</p>
                  <p>And then secondly, A voluntary stipulation, and an agreement with the Father, to become obedient for us, yet this Distinction will be onely in our understanding; and we shall make two <hi>signa rationis,</hi> whereof one is <hi>prius,</hi> and the other <hi>posterius;</hi> But in reality and existency, Christ never had his humane being, but it was under confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us. This is then that which we affirm, That sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Christ to be made a man, and thereby absolutely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to fulfill the Law for himself, yet that he should enter into agreement with the Father, to obey it as a Surety, for such a tearm of years upon the earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to procure Salvation for a sinner undone otherwise: This, I say, is wholly gracious and voluntary, and Christ was not obliged to it as a man. In this respect it is, that Christ is called the second <hi>Adam,</hi> because of the Covenant he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for his people: So that as the first <hi>Adam,</hi> though he was bound in his own person to obey the Law of God, yet was capable of a new obligation for his posterity upon a new ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: So that at the same time, if he had continued, his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience would have been accountable, both to himself and to his posterity. Thus it was with Christ, if we grant, That as man he was bound to obey the Law, yet as a Surety
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:118921:222"/> for us in such a way, he did take the same obligation upon him by another title and consideration: And this truth is made evident thus, If Christ because man was bound to obey the Law, as he did, while on earth, then he was still bound to do so, while he is in heaven, because he doth not cease to be man there; and if obedience do follow upon Christs humane Nature inseparably, as they say, then though in heaven he was obliged to do, as once upon the earth: Grant it therefore, That Christ as man was bound to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law, yet to do it in such a manner, by way of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Father for such a space of time, this is that he was not obliged unto, and so this was wholly voluntary. The Apostle notably urgeth this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Thou hast made him</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>for a little time</hi> (as the best Interpreters expound) <hi>lower then Angels.</hi> This <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, this short time of his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority and debasement under the Law for us, is that which Christ stipulated for, and to which he was not absolutely as man obliged unto. And thus have we finished the second Objection, wherein we have been very large, because here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did seem to lie the strength of <hi>Samson,</hi> and when that is discovered, the other Objections will the more easily yield themselves.</p>

                  <p>WE proceed to a third Argument against the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs active obedience; and its thus urged: <hi>If the active obedience be imputed, then the passive is made whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>3</label> useless: for seeing by that we are made perfectly righteous, and accounted of as those who have fulfilled the Law, what need any further righteousness? Thus</hi> (say they) <hi>Christs death is made to be in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But certainly the weakness and nakedness of this Argument is so visible, that with <hi>Adam,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> it may justly runne to hide it self, for several things are to be answered. First, the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is wholly denied, for there is a necessity both of active and passive obedience. Christs obedience to the Law, did not supply the virtue of his death, no more then his death did the efficacy of his obedience; so that both his active and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive obedience do concurre to make up one integrall compleat legall righteousness; for the Law requiring both these, it behoved our Surety to fulfill them both: Insomuch that if we could have had a perfect righteousness conformable to the Law, <hi>de novo,</hi> and not have satisfied the punishment, our debt would not have been discharged, we had still been in our sins.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Rep.</note>
                     <hi>But</hi> (its replied) <hi>that righteousness is perfect or not, if not perfect, this would be to dishonour Christ; if perfect, yea a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of an infinite worth, then it might serve for all.</hi>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> To this I answer, The whole righteousness Christ purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for us, is a full and a perfect righteousness, to which nothing can be added to make it more perfect: yet this totall righteousness consists of parts which compleat it, which parts have their partial perfection, but not the perfection of the whole. Neither is this any dishonour to Christ to say, that part of his righteousness hath not the perfection of the whole, no more then to say, his humane nature, though it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in its way, had not the perfection of the whole person. Every righteous act of Christ was perfect with that respective partial perfection it needed, and altogether made a total and full perfection. This distinction the opponents must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge even in their passive obedience, for why did not the sufferings of Christs soul bring righteousness enough, why not any pain in his body, as well as death? did not Christ suffer with perfection in these? was there any deficiency in any respect? No certainly, but those partial sufferings were perfect with their respective limited perfection, though no single suffering did amount to that righteousness which his whole sufferings did. Therefore we cannot properly say, any particular work or suffering of Christ was imperfect, though it had not the totall righteousness imputed to us, because that is properly said to be imperfect, which wants something its bound to have: A man is not called imperfect (unless ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively) because he is not like God or the Angels, because man is not bound to have those perfections. And thus it is here, Christs particular acts and sufferings singly and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken, were not bound to have that compleatness and perfection, which when conjoyned, they were possessed with. This is like the Popish argument against the perfection of the Scriptures, for (say they) they are either a perfect rule in the whole, or in the parts of them; if in the parts, then one Book of the Canonicall Scripture is enough, and the other superfluous; if in the whole only, then the parts are imperfect, because they do not sufficiently and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:118921:223"/> direct to salvation.

We may retort on the opponents, If the passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be all the satisfactory righteousness we needed, then his active obedience was wholly useless: why should they be more afraid to shut out his passive obedience, then his active?

Its true, he is propounded as an example; we are to be patient and full of love as he was, but yet it is a very low consideration to make this the only end of his holy life.

Besides, we may argue against this exemplary life only, as they do against the imputation of Christs righteousness: Christ (say they) had not the righteousness of a Magistrate, of an Husband, of a Wife, for he was not in those relations, therefore his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience could not be imputed to such as were in those relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This Objection is to be answered in its time; its weakly urged against the truth we plead for, but strongly urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such, who make his holy life usefull only, because exemplary, for seeing he left no example of his conversation in such a relation, how could he be a pattern to those that were placed therein?</p>

To obey the Law of God for our good only, is not enough; so one godly man may do it for another: Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents do obey Gods commands for the good of their children, Magistrates for the good of their subjects; but Christs obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was more, it was a <hi>fidejusticial</hi> obedience, it was the obedience of an undertaker for us; and therefore it must not only be for our good, but in our stead. Thus when the Martyrs, especially <hi>Paul,</hi> suffered for the Elect, it was <hi>toto genere</hi> different from Christs sufferings for them; the one was only for the good of the Church, the other was in the Churches stead; so Christs obedience and the obedience of Christians, who are commanded to make their light to shine before others, do differ in their whole kinde, for a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans obedience is profitable unto others, but its not as Christ is vicarious and impletive of the Law in stead of others: Therefore this distinction comes too short, and gives not that full glory to him, which belongs to him as our Surety.</p>

                     </label> To this again we Answer, that without doubt, such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is to be acknowledged in Christ, that somethings were in him only qualifying his person, and somethings were properly ingredient unto and constitutive of our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The former was to be considered only <hi>praesuppositivè</hi> and <hi>materialiter</hi> (as we said the Schools speak) The later <hi>forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter,</hi> and <hi>immediatè;</hi> of the former sort are his two natures, his Godhead and his manhood, these two were conjoyned in one person for our good, and they did qualifie his person to be our Redeemer, he must be <hi>medius</hi> before he can be <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi> he was God for our good, but not God in our stead; he was man for our good, but not in our stead. As it is thus to be granted in respect of his natures, so also in those actions which he did upon other considerations, then as a Mediator, for many things it behoved a Mediator to do, which yet he did not as Mediator. Thus his eating and drinking to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his natural life, it behoved him to do thus; for <hi>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord,</hi> is urged by our Saviour against the devils temptation for himself as well as for other men. Now his eating and drinking, though they were <hi>actiones mediatoris,</hi> yet not <hi>actiones mediatoriae:</hi> That is, though Christ the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator did all these things for our good, yet they were not part of that Mediatoriall righteousness for which he stood ingaged, only were required of him <hi>remotè</hi> and <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliter,</hi> as that without which he could not accomplish his mediatory righteousnesse. Therefore there is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to be made between such actions, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to keep him up in the being of a Mediator, and those that were part of his Mediatorship. Its reported of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> that he made himself a captive or servant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem another. Now although while he was in that sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:118921:225"/> his eating and drinking, thereby preserving his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life, was for the good of that captive whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; yet they were not imputed in the same manner, as those peculiar works of slavery and service, which he was bound to do every day: Or if one had undertaken to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he would constantly perform an <hi>Israelites</hi> task for him every day, and make such a number of bricks, though the person so undertaking must necessarily eat and drink, else he could not labour, yet his eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would not be imputed to the <hi>Israelite,</hi> as that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar accomplishing of such a task as the <hi>Israelite</hi> was bound unto. Thus it is in our case, our Lord and Saviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in a form of a servant for us, undertook to redeem us by performing that work we were bound unto: Now his eating and drinking, that was to preserve his bodily life, and although it was for our good, yet it was not for us in the same manner, as the obedience of the Law, in the duties whereof he accomplished that obligation which was upon us, let us then distinguish between those notions which were requisite to qualifie him as a Mediator, and which were part of his Mediatorship; for though our salvation may be attributed to both of them, yet not in the same manner, for the former are required of him as conditions in his person, the later as ingredients to our righteousness: The former he did <hi>pro se, &amp; pro nobis:</hi> The later <hi>loco nostri.</hi> We then do grant the necessity of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, only we blame them for making his active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to be no more then a condition requisite to his being, and so its concurrent to our righteousness no other waies, then his natural actions, or some miraculous actions, which he did indeed for our good, thereby demonstrating he was the true <hi>Messias,</hi> but he did them not as our Surety: neither could they be called <hi>Sponsorious</hi> obedience: So that we may speak of these things, as Divines do about the merit of Christ, Christ (we say) hath merited the sanctification of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, but he merited not that we should be men, that comes not by Christs death: Its only <hi>materialiter,</hi> and <hi>per modum substracti.</hi> This being supposed, Christ merited the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:118921:226"/> sanctification of our natures, as also all other supernatural priviledges.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We must not upon any terms grant that all the active obedience of Christ which he did as a man, was for himself, for this will necessarily overthrow Christs merit for us in his life time. It will assert that Christ did not by his holy life merit salvation for us, but make it wholly in reference to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: and therefore I cannot subscribe to that position I meet with <hi>(Buchol.

                     </label> This seemeth to take away all Christs meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious obedience for us, as in reference to the moral Law. But to discusse it more narrowly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Its ambiguously spoken, that it was not necessary Christ by fulfilling the Law, should merit for us; for there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold necessity, First, Absolute and simple, and thus indeed it was not necessary, no more then it was that he should be man, or being man, that he should converse with us in that manner he did upon the earth. But secondly, there is an hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call necessity, which ariseth from Gods ordination and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of him to be our Mediator, or from the stipulation and agreement between the Father and the Son, to procure our Redemption, and thus it was necessary that he should merit by his obedience for us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It doth impertinently confound Angels and Christ toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this matter, for Angels they are now in <hi>termino,</hi> they partake of heaven and happiness, and so are not capable of any reward for what they do, being instated in it already; whereas Christ, though he had right to eternall glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, yet he put himself into a condition wherein he might merit for us: And therefore</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This assertion is not clear, because it doth not distinguish of those two conditions, <hi>viatores</hi> and <hi>comprehensores.</hi> The Saints glorified in heaven, yea Christ now exalted in glory,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:118921:226"/> doth still retain his humane nature, and thereby is still a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and they do from that inward perfection obey the Law of God materially, though not formally. But there was another consideration both of them and Christ, while they were here on earth. Although it be acknowledged, that Christ, while bodily on the earth, was a comprehensor, yet it is as generally confessed likewise, he was a viator. I will not intangle the Reader with Scholastical intricacies, that are so industriously, but unprofitably vented in this matter. This seemeth to be clear, that though Christ had a right to all happiness, and that from his personal union, yet he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self voluntarily in such a condition, that he might be under a promise with God, which was by that stipulation mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. If <hi>he did pour out his soul an offering for sin, he should see the travell of his soul and be satisfied:</hi> And by reason of this promise, upon the fulfilling of what he undertook, he was capable of merit, if not for himself, yet for us; so that Christ though in respect of his humane nature even in heaven, he be obliged to love God, yet he is not there in a state of merit, as he was on earth, because no longer under a promise and sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation; and thus the glorified Saints and Angels, though they love God and do his will, yet its but obedience only materially, because no more under a promise of reward, and is not so much looked upon as their duty, as it is their part of blessedness: even as to praise God, and rejoyce in him is not so much considered as a duty required by the Law, but as part of that glorious blessedness they are made partakers of. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that assertion is dark and cloudy, because it makes no distinction of a rational creature, whether it be in <hi>viâ,</hi> or in <hi>patriâ,</hi> whether under a promise or not.</p>
                  <p>Yea fourthly, It puts those two things together, which are of a very different consideration, and that is Christ merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for himself or for us: For there are some Learned and sound Divines, <hi>Calvin</hi> especially, that deny Christ merited for himself, yet I know none, till of late, that question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he merited for man or no.</p>

                  <p>ALthough it seemeth farre more probable that Christ merited that great Exaltation of himself, as Mediator, which the Scripture so much speaks of by his humiliation here on earth, and yet even that exalted glory he did not so much look upon as his good, as the Churches over which he was thus constituted to be a glorious Head. No doubt but while on the earth he was King and Head of his Church, as the Orthodox maintain against <hi>Socinians,</hi> yet after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection there was a further possession of glory then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:118921:227"/> his body that formerly was passible, being now made glorious. As for the glory of his Divine Nature he doth not pray for the possessing of that, <hi>John</hi> 17. seeing he had it from the beginning with the Father, but onely for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of it. But his Mediatory glory, that he was fully invested into upon his Resurrection, and this seemeth more consonant to Scripture, especially that known place, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Wherefore God hath highly exalted him,</hi> &amp;c. For although it is true, that the phrase may denote no more then a meer consequence, or the order that was appointed between his obedience and glory, yet the whole context doth rather fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that Exposition, which makes it as a reward merited by his obedience; and indeed, if we grant, that stipulation and agreement between the Father and the Sonne, concerning the redemption of man-kinde; I cannot see how it can be denied, that Christ merited for himself, seeing the Father promised him not only a seed and inheritance, but his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dominion and Majesty thereby, although (as was said) even this glory of Christ did tend to our good and comfort: Neither hath that Argument any strength to the contrary, That Christ by the personal union had right to all, and so no glory or blessednesse could be denied him; for its no absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to say, That Christ might have right to this glory upon a two-fold Title; 1. By personal Union. 2. By obedience: Even as the sonne of some great Monarch may have a right to his Kingdome both by inheritance or succession, and then further by conquest overcoming his subjects, who have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen up rebelliously against him: and this makes more for the glory and honour of Christ, that he would be lifted up to this glory by his humiliation, when it had been no robbery to have taken it otherwayes. It was not then out of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency or necessity that Christ would partake of this glory in a meritorious way of obedience, but by voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension, the more to commend his love to us therein. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever let Christs meriting for himself be wholly laid aside, yet that he should not merit for us by his holy life, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his death, I think is such a <hi>Novelism</hi> that the Church of God, though under many declensions and eclypses, scarce
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:118921:228"/> ever was infested with; for who can perswade himself that Christ should be made man, made under the Law, and he in such a state of humiliation about thirty years, and not all that while be meriting for us, but in that short time of his death? Is it not strange, that he who was made man to be our Mediator, yet should perform no Mediatorial act, till the time of his sufferings? Certainly the Scripture represents Christ our Mediator in all that he did, as well as in what he suffered; for although some things in his life were but acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory and adjuvant, yet the principal and main things of his life were constitutive of our righteousnesse; neither do we advance Christ as we ought, if we look upon his obedience, not as <hi>fide-jussorial,</hi> but singly and privately for himself. Hence <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7. the Apostle takes notice of all that obedience of his, which he shewed even from the beginning of his being <hi>in the form of a servant, untill the death of the Crosse;</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. There that will of his, which he had upon his coming into the world, is made the foundation of all that after-obedience which he shewed untill the oblation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And here in my Text, the Apostle attributed our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse to his obedience indefinitely and universally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limiting it to the time of his death. Hence also in <hi>Isai.</hi> 53. where there is so clear a Prophecy of his Mediatorship, mention is not onely made of his sufferings, but his holy life, <hi>By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justifie many,</hi> vers. 11. and <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth;</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> considers, <hi>That it was the Just who suffered for the unjust,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18 I see is dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Divines, <hi>Whether Christ performed any Mediatorial acts before his incarnation? [Vide</hi> Rivet, <hi>in Hosea. cap.</hi> 12.] The Question is not, Whether the fruit of his Mediatorship did not extend to all before Christs birth? For all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox confesse that: But, Whether he could perform any acts of his Mediatory Office, till he was made man, seeing he was Mediator in both his Natures, and its acknowledged that in respect of his Priestly Office he could not do any Mediatorial acts, but in his Prophetical he did? But now we see it disputed, Whether Christ when made man did exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:118921:228"/> Mediatorial acts till the time of his oblation? and not only disputed but concluded, That the holinesse of his life was not meritorious for us. Certainly, that place <hi>John</hi> 17.4. might be enough to convince, where Christ saith, <hi>I have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the work thou gavest me to do,</hi> relating to the whole obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his life, as well as respecting his death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having discharged his whole work, he prayeth for his glorification.</p>
                  <p>I shall adde one thing more worthy of consideration, if this be admitted as true, <hi>That Christ did not merit for us by his active obedience to the Moral Law, because he was subject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto for himself as a creature, Whether this once yielded unto will not also overthrow the merit of his Passive Obedience?</hi> For <hi>Durand. [lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Distinct.</hi> 21. <hi>Quaest.</hi> 2.] a Schoolman of no mean note, doth upon this account affirm, That Christ did not satisfie the Justice of God by his death, properly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, because his humane Nature having received so many mercies from God being a creature, that it could never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense God enough for it self in respect of those favours received. He proceedeth upon this Rule, That there is the same reason of obligation, for satisfaction in respect of sinne committed, and of recompence in respect of benefit recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. He that cannot exactly and rigidly do the later, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rigidly do the former. Now Christ as man received those inestimable mercies and favours both of Nature and Grace, as the personal Union, habitual Holinesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he could not requite this goodnesse of God to him: Thereupon he maketh a distinction of satisfaction, answerable to that which the Schools have of merit. A Satisfaction <hi>de condigno,</hi> when there is a just and equal proportion between the fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the satisfaction profered; or a satisfaction <hi>de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruo,</hi> which is, when there is no just proportion in this case of offence, only the friendship and love of the party inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, doth accept of that which of it self is not equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
                  <p>This distinction is much like that of <hi>Vorstius</hi> his Divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptilation which he speaks of in this case. Now observe the ground why he makes Christs satisfaction by his passive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:118921:229"/> to be no more then a satisfaction <hi>de congruo,</hi> or a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull acceptation of that as equivalent, which is not so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. It is upon this ground, because Christ as a man recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved such benefits from God, that let him do or suffer never so great things, yet he could not compensate for the benefits he himself received. According to that of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which he alledgeth 8<seg rend="sup">o</seg>
                     <hi>Ethic.</hi> That no man can render equivalent to the gods and his parents. I do not examine the truth and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of this Argument, only I desire the opponents to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it by their principles, and this will appear still the more effectual against them, if that Position be acknowledged, which some Divines of great note affirm, That God by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the supream dominion and power he hath over any creature, may impose exquisite and unspeakable torments on a rational creature <hi>per modum simplicis cruciatus,</hi> though not <hi>per modum poenae,</hi> which doth necessarily presuppose sinne. To be sure, we see God from his dominion he had over <hi>Job,</hi> exercising of him with wonderfull sorrows and anguishes; and although <hi>Job</hi> was not without sin, yet they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for sinne, but upon trial; If then God may without any wrong lay any trouble upon the creature, as a creature, and that is bound patiently to bear it, yea and all those suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings cannot be equivalent to that goodnesse and love of God which the creature partaketh of; Would not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory man say, That whatsoever Christ as man suffered, yet because in those sufferings he was supported and corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated by God, he could not merit, because what he had was received from above, and so he was by way of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse obliged to return it to God again.</p>
                  <p>Again, There is another Position by the same Schoolmen, which will much presse the adversary, and makes against the passive obedience, as well as the active, and that is from the necessity of Christs death; for this he affirmeth [<hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct.</hi> 17. <hi>Quaest.</hi> 1.] That Christ would naturally have grown old and died, as other men, if so be that he had not been violently put to death; He grounds this upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, that Christ took mans nature upon him in a passible way, and so all those defects which do necessarily
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:118921:229"/> and indeclinably concomitate mans nature in such a way. Now then I thus argue, If Christ taking our passible nature upon him, was obnoxious to death, as well as to be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and thirsty, and to be weary, then there was the same obligation upon him in respect of death, as of obedience to the Law, and as his being a rational creature did necessarily oblige him to obey the Law; so being made man like unto us in all infirmities (sinne onely excepted) he was also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to a necessity of dying.</p>
                  <p>If to all this it be said, <hi>That though it be granted, Christ was obnoxious to death, yet not in such a manner, and so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated, and in that respect it might be satisfactory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is as easily answered, That though Christ as man was obliged to the duty of the Moral Law, yet that he should submit himself to it in such a manner, for such a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate space of time upon the earth; this was wholly free and voluntary, and so in this respect might be meritorious for us. I intreat the Reader to take notice, that I do no wayes approve of this Discourse of <hi>Durands,</hi> onely its brought <hi>ad hominem,</hi> to have them seriously weigh, Whether the same principles that deny the meritoriousnesse of Christs active obedience, do not also tend to the overthrow of the Satisfactory Nature of his passive, for the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood of this Schoolmans position lieth in this, as if Christs Satisfaction in the vertue of it was meerly of man, and not of him who was God as well as man; and therefore though a pure meer man suffering, could not satisfie God, among other reasons, for that of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands,</hi> because all his support and strength he had from God; yet he that is God as well as man is by that infinite worth redounding from the person to the actions he did, fully inabled to make exact and compleat Satisfaction This false supposition maketh others also deny the imputation of Christs active obedience, as appearech by the Authour of that Book, called, <hi>The Price of Mans Redemption,</hi> where he distinguisheth Christs legal obedience from his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial, and makes that to be done by him as a man, as if Christs actions did not come from him as he was a person,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:118921:230"/> God-man, though the formal principles by which they were effected, were either his Divine or humane Nature. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therefore it be granted, That Christ as man was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the Moral Law, yet what action he did in reference thereunto, being the action of him that was God as well as man, it was of infinite worth for us, especially it being intended and applied by our Saviour for that end.</p>
                  <p>Before I finish this particular, it will not be altogether impertinent to consider, <hi>What is the true Doctrine about Christs death, whether it was natural, or meerly miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some (you have heard) affirm, <hi>That Christ because he took our passible Nature upon him, would have died, though he had not been violently put to death. For</hi> (say they) <hi>as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Ʋnion did not prohibit a violent death, no more would it a natural; and as it was no reproach or dishonour to Christ to die a violent death, no more would it have been to die a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another late Writer, <hi>[Pinchin, Price of Redemption]</hi> among other new and wonderfull opinions, asserts this also, <hi>That Christs death was wholly miraculous, that all the</hi> Romans <hi>and</hi> Jews <hi>could not put him to death, but he did voluntary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve that union of the soul and body himself; so that he did not by those pains die as other men from the principles of nature, but by his own voluntary concurrence.</hi> But this is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.15. 1 <hi>Thessal.</hi> 2.15. where they are charged expresly to have <hi>killed Christ,</hi> and that as they did the other Prophets. Its true, there were many wonders about Christs death, and in some sense it might be said to be miraculous, but not so as therefore it should be denied to be also in some sense natural: Therefore the truth lieth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two extreams; for though Christ took our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him with the principles of death, yet it may not be said, he would have died naturally, if they had not cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him; for that is said to be future, not which is to be so according to the second and inferiour causes, but what is according to the singular Will and appointment of God:
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:118921:230"/> Now God had appointed his death for no other end but to be by way of a voluntary oblation for us, which it could not be if it had been the tribute of Nature: Neither do the principles of dying argue death necessarily, for <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were in mortal natures, yet they did not actually die, and at the last day many shall not die, but have an equivalent change: Even as we may say, The body of Christ in the grave could not putrifie or corrupt, because of Gods singular will about the speedy Resurrection of it; for its said, <hi>He would not suffer his holy One to see corruption:</hi> So that its unjustifiable to say, Christ would have died natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he had not been put to that violent death; and though Christ was <hi>hungry</hi> and <hi>weary,</hi> yet we never reade that he was <hi>sick.</hi> Nay, Divines say, he could not be any wayes capable of any bodily sicknesse. But yet on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, its an errour to say, Christs death was wholly miraculous, that by the punishment of the Crosse, with the pains thereof, there was not a natural death. Neither could his enemies kill him; for although this be true in respect of his Divine Nature, so that he could have hindred all the men of the world from killing of him: So that in respect of his Divine Will, he said, <hi>He had power to lay down his life, and to raise it again;</hi> yet seeing his Divine Nature did leave the humane Nature in its operations to its self, without which our Redemption could not be accomplished; in this dereliction his death did proceed from natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, even as his hunger and wearinesse. Its true, Christ did not die against his humane will, for with that he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted of the death imposed on him; yet for all that we may not say he killed himself, or was his own executioner. And thus much occasionally.</p>
                  <p>That which I chiefly intended, is to examine, <hi>Whether some Arguments that militate against the Active Obedience, do not also rise up against the Passive.</hi> And we may take notice, That <hi>Bernard (Epist.</hi> 190.) writing against <hi>Abilardus,</hi> the first that ever appeared to deny the Satisfactory Propitiation by Christs death, making it onely exemplary, doth oppose him, not onely by asserting the redeeming power in Christs
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:118921:231"/> death, but the imputation also of his righteous obedience: Hence are those expressions, <hi>Assignata est ei aliena justitia qui caruit suâ,</hi> Anothers righteousnesse is assigned to him, who wanted one of his own. Again, <hi>Justum me dixerim sed illius Justitiâ; quaenam ipsa? finis legis Christus ad Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiam omni credenti,</hi> I will call my self righteous, but by his righteousnesse; And what is that? <hi>Christ is the end of the Law for righteousnesse to him that beleeveth.</hi> Lastly, That it is very clear, <hi>Si mea traducta culpa, cur non &amp; mea indulta Justitia? &amp; sane mihi tutior donata, quam si inherens,</hi> If <hi>Adams</hi> sinne can by traduction be made mine, why not righteousnesse be also indulged and imputed to me? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly righteousnesse thus given is more safe then what is inherent. This righteousnesse is not onely to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his death, but to his whole conversation in the world for us.</p>

And thus it is in his passive Obedience, Christ laid down his life as a ransome and price for his, yet not so as they are thereby immediately acquitted from all guilt, but the efficacy of it is communicated unto such as take the way he hath prescribed; so that neither active or passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ, do any good but to such who apply it in that way God hath commanded: The effects of Christs death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not immediately accomplished upon any, but mediately according to those instituted means he hath required.</p>

                     </label> To this several things are responsible. 1. There is a calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niating mistake interposed in the Argument, as if it were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted. That a man by imputed righteousness, is as righteous as Christ. This is the frequent reviling of our Doctrine, by
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:118921:232"/> Popish Writers. The Orthodox renounce any such conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and will not suffer such a Viper to fasten on them. Its one thing to say, that the righteousness of Christ is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to a believer, and another thing that he is as righteous as Christ. For 1. Christs righteousness is not imputed to us, according to that latitude and infinite worth it is in Christ, but according to our necessity and want. 2. Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is in Christ personally and inherently, and so deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minateth him from an intrinsecal ground, but it is in us only by imputation and account, and that according as we receive it by faith, which is imperfect and full of wavering. 3. Its in Christ efficiently, so that he is the Author and procurer of it. It is in us only as the subjects who do receive it. This and much more is to be said to manifest the weakness of that position (We are as righteous as Christ.) But more of this in answering the Popish Argument.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In answer to this charge, we say, that the <hi>Socinian</hi> doth in like manner argue against satisfaction by the passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ in his death; for thus they argue, Where the whole debt is paid, there remaineth no more debt, but Christ by his death hath paid the whole debt, therefore there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more. What is this, but that God can see no sin in that for whom Christ hath satisfied? for sinne is the debt and all that is discharged; God will not require the payment of the same debt twice. Thus (say they) the doctrine of Christs satisfaction opens a door to all impiety, and makes all holiness needless. Now what is answered to this in behalf of the passive obedience, may as truly and fully be improved like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for active obedience.</p>
                  <p>But 3. we may say to the opponents, Why do they not pull this beam out of their own eye first; for this if it be a chain of Iron, will binde them as well as any. They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do acknowledge a satisfactory righteousness by Christs death; and upon this account they plead against the active obedience, because when the penalty of the Law is removed, and all sinne of omission and commission satisfied for, there remaineth no more accusation of the Law; the Law is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly satisfied, and therefore can no more condemn. Then
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:118921:233"/> certainly, where the Law cannot accuse, there sinne cannot be imputed: So that the two opinions about active and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive obedience differ not in this, Whether the Law be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly satisfied, and an infinite atonement made, but only Whether the passive doth solely concurre, or active and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive both.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the fourth place, the true and solid Answer, to vindicate the Doctrine of active and passive obedience from such uncharitable consequences, is, That the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs doing and suffering for us, is not absolute and immediately taking place, without any order or means, but God hath so ordained the communication of this rich and infinite treasure, that whosoever believeth and walketh holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is made partaker hereof; and therefore this righteousness is received <hi>ad modum recipientis:</hi> now the faith of the best believer is subject to paraliticall shakings, every one may cry out, <hi>Lord I believe, help my unbelief.</hi> The cruise we bring is not large enough to hold all the oyl, for as Divines say, even of the blessed and glorified Saints in heaven, though made perfect, yet that they do not know, love, or rejoyce in God, comprehensively, as much as God injoyeth himself: How much more is it true, that no godly man in this life, who hath imperfections mingled with all his graces, can truly and fully receive Christ, <hi>quoad ultimum quod sic,</hi> so that no more of Christ is to be received? Though therefore the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness imputed be perfect, yet the receiving and participation of it is imperfect; and as we say in sanctification against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, Though good works in respect of the Spirit of God or grace from which they flow are perfect, yet in respect of us, who do subordinately act, they receive imperfection; so though the obedience of Christ, as it is accomplished by him be every way perfect, and hath no sinne in it, yet as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it there is much imperfection in us, and so God must needs see sinne in us, while we do stretch out our hands to lay hold on it; Though by the imputation of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, then this weakness is so covered, that its not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us. Therefore when the Antinomian would illustrate their dangerous opinion, as flowing from Christs imputed
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:118921:233"/> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, from a similitude of a red glass, by which every thing in the glass is represented to be red, and nothing then can appear otherwise then red, so God seeth nothing but the righteousness of Christ in his people, and therefore no sinne, but they are as righteous as Christ. This halteth down right, and is not to the purpose, for therefore doth the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a red glass seem red, because the <hi>medium</hi> is <hi>indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> there is not a fit <hi>medium</hi> to conveigh the <hi>species</hi> of the object, so that in such seeing, the visive faculty is deceived, and apprehends things otherwise then they are: But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without blasphemy attribute such imperfections to God, for God seeth all things as they are with an intuitive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; there cannot be any indisposed <hi>medium</hi> to his eye; to him darkness and light are all one, therefore he cannot but see the imperfect graces, and other sins of his people which are in them, notwithstanding this imputation: only he doth not so see them, as to punish them being already satisfied for in Christ. But the Antinomian doth not only deny a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial seeing of them, but even an intuitive: Of which errour I have elsewhere spoken more largely, <hi>(Vindic. Legis.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though Christs perfect obedience be imputed, God doth see sinne in Believers, because this righteousness is not inherent in them. Therefore they confound imputation and inherency, who would gather thorns of this Vine, and turn this fish into a serpent; If so be that imputation did take away the inherent filth of our natures, then God would no more see sinne in us, then he doth in the glorified Saints of heaven. But with this imputation is consistent these reliques of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, which sometimes also are very active, and which God takes notice of in his people, and for which he doth in this life chastice them: Though therefore the imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ be as truly ours, as if it were inherent, yet it is not inherent, and so what corruption doth abide in us, God cannot but see it. And that this may be the more trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, let us call in the</p>
                  <p>Sixth Argument, which is an arrow out of the Popish qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> Thus at large Popish Writers and others expatiate in the decrying of this imputed righteousness, grosly mistaking all the while the sense in which this imputed obedience is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and therefore let us Answer the Objection united together, though from different Authors, with different principles.</p>
                  <p>First, To be made formally righteous with Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is an ambiguous and deceitfull expression; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the opponents seem to take formally in a Physicall sense, as a form inwardly denominating a man, as a man is said to be wise by wisdom, to be healthfull by health. Thus they attribute to us, as if we asserted a man absolutely just in our selves by such an imputed righteousness. Whereas this sense is wholly renounced by Protestant Writers, as a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, therefore many Learned Authours refuse the word formall, and say, Christs righteousness is the matter of our Evangelicall righteousness, which received by faith, we are thereby made righteous: Although there are very worthy and pious Writers that do grant the word <hi>formaliter,</hi> for they say, this formality is not in us, but in <hi>reputatione divina,</hi> so that we are not to conceive of it as a <hi>Physical,</hi> but <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Legal</hi> formality; as when it is said a prisoner is acquitted, the formality of this lieth not in any thing inherent in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, but in the Judges absolution: so when a believer is constituted, First, It is not by any thing infused in him, but what is accounted by Covenant through Christ unto him. And if men were not captious in this sense, we might safely and roundly affirm, that by Christs obedience imputed to us, we are formally made righteous; for even amongst the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists themselves there are acknowledged extrinsecall forms that do give a denomination to the object, as when such a
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:118921:234"/> thing is said to be known or seen, here is a denomination from an extrinsecall form, yea its the generall opinion of many Schoolmen, that a man might be accepted of by God, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously, though there be no inward change or infusion of holiness in him: Now in such cases supposed, a man would have been said to be accepted of and beloved by God from a meer extrinsecall respect; So that the foundation of this mistake lieth herein, that they will not distinguish between an <hi>absolute physicall</hi> form, informing its subject, and a <hi>moral, relative, state</hi> in a man, which receiveth its denominations from some extrinsecal causes. It may then, if the phrase be understood <hi>civiliter</hi> and <hi>legaliter,</hi> not <hi>physice,</hi> be granted that we are made formally righteous by Christs obedience impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us; although to avoid needless contentions, which men are so prone to make, for peace sake, its called rather the matter of our righteousness. Secondly, And though this be granted, yet it doth not follow, that we are as righteous as Christ, for the reasons briefly mentioned before, and now more properly to be insisted on.</p>
                  <p>For first, This is not imputed to every believer,<note place="margin">Though Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness be imputed to us, yet we are not as righteous as Christ.</note> according to the dignity and worth that it hath, as formally abiding in Christ, but according to the necessity and exigence of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man; so that it is to be conceived in the manner of an universall and infinite Treasure, which makes rich every poor man interested therein, though not one of them hath all the Treasure communicated to him, but respectively and distributively for his use: Or as the Sunne filleth every starre with its proper respective light, yet is not thereby made as glorious as the Sunne: So that Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n Christ, and as imputed, differ; for it is in Christ as the subject naturally recipient of it; it is in us according to our necessity, that partake of it by faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Its in Christ as the efficient, and he that doth work it; it is in us as the passive subject for whom its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, insomuch that its abhorrent from all reason, to say, that because Christs obedience is imputed to us, therefore we are Redeemers and Saviours; but in a passive sense, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are redeemed and saved: Insomuch that none say
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:118921:235"/> Christs obedience is imputed unto us, in such a sense as that we should be said to be the efficients of that righteousness, but that we should be the passive subjects receiving the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it. And indeed if there be not some kinde of imputation of what Christ suffered for us, how can it be said, that <hi>Christ died for us,</hi> that he was a <hi>Surety for us.</hi> This is so evident and clear, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself confesseth that Christs merits are imputed unto u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, because they are given to us, and we may offer them up to God the Father for our sins, because Christ took upon him the burden of satisfying God for us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of us to the Father: In this sense (saith he) the Protestants opinion would be right; though he addeth, <hi>Quamvis modus loquendi in Scripturis, &amp; Patribus, aut nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, aut rarissime inveniatur:</hi> Which later clause makes the whole saying like new wine in the old bottle, it breaketh and marreth all. Only thus farre we have a confession, that Christs satisfactory righteousness is so given to us, that we may offer it to the Father for our selves. Now will it follow that because its given to us, therefore we are as righteous as Christ, and we are Redeemers?</p>
                  <p>In the third place, consider, That there is a distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the obedience it self, and the manner of application of it: though the obedience imputed, be of infinite worth and dignity, yet the application of it is in a finite and limitted manner. If a Jewel of rich price be laid down for many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives, there is a great difference between the price of the Jewel and the application of it: The application of it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and respective, not according to the whole worth of the Jewel, for one man, especially this application being made with much imperfection and weakness. But to lay the axe to the root of the tree, that it may never grow more,</p>
                  <p>Lastly take notice, That this whole Argument is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sand, for in Christ there is his Office, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness acquired or purchased by his Office: Now we do not say, his Office is imputed to us, nor so is his Mediatory obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as its the execution of his Office imputed to us, but the righteousnesse he merits and obtains by this; so that though Christ be our Surety, yet we are not thereby made Sureties:
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:118921:235"/> That is ridiculous to say, the debtor is made a Surety, because the Surety undertakes for him. Christs Office of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is incommunicable, but the righteousness acquited by it is to be communicated to every member of his. Therefore we grant it would be blasphemy for any to conceit he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in Christs robes: In this sense, we justly blame the Papists for making <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints Mediators:</hi> They hold Christ merited and satisfied, that we might merit and satisfie: This is to hold the imputation of Christs Mediatorial Office, unto a creature, which no doubt Christ is jealous of; but the truth we plead for is as distant from this as light from darkness. Its not the Office, nor the executory acts thereof that are imputed to us, but that righteousness which is the effect and fruit of these. And this may more then suffice for this Objection.</p>
                  <p>In the sixth place, its objected, <label type="milestone">

                     </label>
                     <hi>That the active obedience of Christ cannot be imputed to every believer for their legall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, because Christ did not perform such a righteousness as was fitted for every person and every relation.

Christ did not perform the duties of many rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, such as a Wife, a Servant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore how shall they stand justified by the legal obedience of Christ, when that righteousness of his was not conformable to that part of the moral Law which concerned them in their relations?</hi> To this also I may adde a further Objection, though of the same affinity, <hi>Infants dying need not the imputation of the active obedience of Christ, for seeing no actual obedience was required of them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they needed not the imputation of such a righteousness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Answer this, first take notice also, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> that the <hi>Socinian</hi> doth thus argue against the passive satisfactory obedience of Christ, which yet the Learned opponents do cordially abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate; and what Answer they would shape to their Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, will serve for this. The <hi>Socinian</hi> argueth, Christ did not die as a Surety in our stead, for then he must have suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that we ought to do; but he did not suffer eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and as for a temporall death (saith he) then he was bound to suffer as many individual deaths, as every man was
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:118921:236"/> to die. Therefore in the second place its truly Answered, That as Christ in suffering death for us, was not thereby bound to suffer every kinde of death or sickness, which yet is the curse of the Law for sinne, but death in the substance of it, so neither was Christ bound to obey for every relation, but its enough that he fulfilled the Law by loving of God, and his neighbour, which is made the summe and substance of the Moral. If a Surety pay the debtors summe of money he oweth (suppose an 100<seg rend="sup">Ib</seg>) in gold, and not in so many several shillings or other pieces of silver, he is by the Civil Law discharged of his debt. As therefore it would be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to say, that a man afflicted with the gout, or troubled with any other infirmity, could take no comfort from Christ, in respect of sinne the cause of it, because Christ never had any such distemper or pain; for its enough that by his death he overcame sinne in all the particular effects of it. Thus every Christian in his several relations may support himself from that obedience which Christ did perform to the substance of the Law: for as in his sufferings, the dignity of his person made up the accidentals by equivalency, especially in such things as were inconsistent with his person, as despair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so in the accidentals of obedience, the dignity of Christs sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial obedience did make compensation, especially in such things as were incompatible to his Mediatorship: As to be a woman, or wife, to be a temporal Magistrate, these things were not consistent with that Office of a Mediator, he had undertaken: and seeing by the adversaries themselves it is acknowledged, that love is virtually and eminently the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law, what need any further dispute? If it be said, that the Law holds no <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it must have eye for eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not this overthrow his passive obedience as well? for what he suffered was not every way <hi>idem,</hi> or the same which the Law required: But the weakness of this will be discovered in the next Objection, only what hath been said for several relations, the duties whereof Christ never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, will also answer the doubt about infants, Christ obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience being communicated to every subject, according to the necessity of it.</p>

                  <p>I Meet with a seventh Objection against the Imputation of Christs active Obedience in the sense contended for, which is managed in this manner, <hi>This Doctrine</hi> (its said)<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>7</label>
                     <hi>supposeth us to have been in Christ, at least in a legal title, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we did believe, or were born, and that not only in a general and conditional sense, as all men, but in a special, as the Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And to this purpose it is again urged, <hi>That this opinion seemeth to ascribe to God a mistaking judgement, or to esteem us to have been in Christ when we were not, and to have done and suffered in him, what we did not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Answer this, First, by the way, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> I fear a snake is in this grasse, else I cannot understand that passage; All men are in Christ in a general and conditional sense; I doubt if this be opened, some viperous brood may be discovered: Will not this make Christ a conditional Head, and his death a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional death? and so if closely pursued assert at last, That though Christ died, yet not one man might be justified. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, Is there any condition required in the person to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, that is not the fruit and effect of Christs death? Did not Christ die to sanctifie us, as <hi>John</hi> 17.18. as well as to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:118921:237"/> us? Are not faith and repentance purchased by Christs death as well as Gospel-priviledges? Did Christ die for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, if they did beleeve; for true penitents, if they did repent? I might enlarge my self in this, to shew how use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and helplesse this Assertion is, either doctrinally to evade any difficulty (for which yet it seemeth at first it was invented) or practically to give any true solid comfort, doubting about the particularity of the benefit by Christs death: But this would be to erre from my scope.</p>
                  <p>In the second place therefore I come to the Argument, as relating to my work in hand; and here I must freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that I see not the least shadow of any such consequence, <hi>viz. That the Imputation of Christs actual obedience doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose us to be actually justified in him before we had a being.</hi> Its true, the <hi>Antinomians</hi> they use to make such <hi>non sequiturs,</hi> but not so much, as I remember, from Christs actual obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as his passive. Therefore some of them urge, That because its said, <hi>God laid on him the iniquities of us all, and he bore our sinnes upon the Crosse,</hi> from that time every beleever was actually justified (though others of that way carry it as high as to eternity it self:) So that this is no more a genuine issue of the Doctrine of the imputation of Christs active obedience, then of his passive; and indeed if it could be fastened upon either, it would more consonantly follow from his passive obedience. Hence the <hi>Socinian</hi> argueth from the Doctrine of Christs death as a ransome and price, that all men shall be saved; <hi>For</hi> (say they) <hi>when the price is paid, and accepted of, its injustice to afflict the Debtor any more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thirdly, There are eminently learned men, that are deservedly reckoned in the number of the Orthodox, that do positively hold, <hi>That the members of Christ were formally justified in him, before they had a being;</hi> as we say, <hi>All were formally made sinners in</hi> Adam, <hi>before they had a natural being.</hi> Though I have elsewhere modestly given in reasons for my dissent herein, and as yet am not convinced to approve of it, or subscribe to it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the last place, the true and proper Answer is,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:118921:237"/> That though Christs active obedience be imputed to us, yet it is in such a way and manner as God hath appointed: Even as although Christ died for the remission of our sinnes, yet this is not actually applied to any, but in the Method God hath ordained, so it is with his active obedience, for these effects of his death do not flow from it by way of a naturall resultancy, for then all would be justified, all would be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but according to that ordered way which is appointed in Scripture: So that in this particular the passive obedience and active are all one; neither doth this Argument oppose one more then the other: Neither can any mistake be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God by the opinion of active obedience, more then passive; for God doth not account these things as ours, but when they are ours; when God looks upon us as fulfilling the Law in Christ, its a truth, and we do so; only its by a civil and legal account, or rather its by that gracious Covenant which the Father made with Christ our Surety, by which means we may <hi>in ordine gratiae,</hi> say of Christ, which Christ said <hi>in ordine naturae,</hi> of his Father, <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are are mine,</hi> though with much disproportion and dissimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</p>
                  <p>The eighth Objection deserveth more serious considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>8</label>
                     <hi>viz. That the opinion of imputation of the active obedience of Christ, supposeth Christ to have paid the</hi> Idem, <hi>and not the</hi> Tantundem, <hi>whereas its thought, that Christ only paid the value, and not the same debt that was due.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But first, I cannot see the naturality of this consequence, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> yea its thought by the Opponents the clean contrary; for we heard one Argument objected against this active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was, because Christ did not perform the duties of all several relations, not of a wife, or a servant, or a Magistrate; and therefore such an imputation could not justifie those who were so related; for the Law requireth that of them, which Christ never did. Thus you see this Doctrine of Christs active obedience is assaulted, because it doth not make Christ pay the <hi>Idem,</hi> and yet how it is arraigned, for making Christ to pay the same, and not the value.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I conceive it is very dangerous to assert, That Christ
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:118921:238"/> paid the same rigidly every way, as also to affirm, that he did no wayes pay the same, but what was equivalent: That Christ did not rigidly pay the same in every respect is plain, because he died but one death, whereas every sinner was bound to die his particular death, so that Christ was to have died as many deaths, as they in particular, had not his own served for all, and so his death was but for a season, not eternall, whereas that which the sinner should have suffered would have been eternal. Now eternall duration was equivalently made up by the dignity of the person. Thus it was also for Christs active obedience, those particular duties which were required in several relations, were equivalently made up by his summary obedience in his love to God and man, it being impossible that this love should be diversified in all respects; for Christ could not be a man and a woman, a servant and a Magistrate at the same time: So that as he was tempted like us in all things, sinne onely excepted, thus he did obey <hi>like us in all things,</hi> onely such things excepted, that did suppose such an imperfection as was incompatible with his Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or else did include an impediment or hinderance of it. It is then granted, That in circumstantials or accidentals, as also in such things which would have argued either sinne or some impediment to his mediatory Office, there was not the <hi>Idem</hi> paid, but the <hi>Tantundem,</hi> and necessity compels to this, for he could not in such a condition have accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our redemption. But if we speak of the Substantials and Essentials, which the Law required or threatned, then we must take heed of a <hi>Tantundem,</hi> lest it prove no satisfaction at all at last; for grant that the Law in the threatning part, and in the preceptive part, was not substantially compleated by Christ, then what need any Satisfaction at all? Justice was to be satisfied, because the Law was to be satisfied: if then the Law be abrogated or changed, so that the penalty required is not necessarily to be born, nor the duty it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded necessarily to be fulfilled, I see not thus why Christs death should be called a Satisfaction: Therefore it is we speak of the Substantials of the preceptive and comminative part of the Law, we must hold that Christ paid the <hi>Idem,</hi> I
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:118921:238"/> do not mean <hi>numero,</hi> but <hi>specie,</hi> the same in kinde that the Law required of us; and therefore it was, that though Christ in his Agonies did sweat drops of bloud, yet this was not Satisfaction, because the Law required death; and thus though Christ died, yet his death could not be equivalent, or in the room of active obedience to the Law, because that required actual righteousnesse, as well as bearing the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Again, If Christ did not pay the same in kinde, but <hi>Tantundem,</hi> then the verity of the Law, and the veracity of the Law-giver fals to the ground; Why is it that the Law is said to be established, that no <hi>iota</hi> or <hi>tittle of it shall passe away,</hi> unlesse because though it be not fulfilled in us, yet it is in our Surety? Why is it said, That none can be justified by the Law, but because the Law still requireth perfect and compleat holinesse? we must not then think that the Law ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the preceptive or threatning part is changed and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from what it was once. Furthermore its of necessity, that Christ must pay the <hi>Idem</hi> in the Substantials of the Law, because the learned Opponents do grant, That God did not abrogate or repeal that Law, <hi>In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die the death;</hi> If then it was neither abrogated nor repealed, but admitted of a relaxation, then certainly the <hi>Idem in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> was paid by Christ; and if this be granted in the penalty of it, in respect of Christs passive obedience, I confesse I cannot yet see why it should not also be yielded in respect of the active obedience; For why should that Law stand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things the Law required,</hi> and therefore Christ must be made a curse, and not that Law also, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> and therefore Christ must do this as well as suffer this for us, if we would live: And this will be still the more undeniable, if we consider, that Christ came into the world as a Surety for us: So that what he did, though it was out of grace and favour to us, yet he was pleased to make it his obligation and debt for us, ere he would discharge it. As for that <hi>crambe</hi> so often boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That if Christ paid the <hi>Idem,</hi> then he must despair and suffer the worm of conscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We have answered enough already; onely we may adde, that if it be thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:118921:239"/> considered, despair as it is a sinne, is not in the damned in hell, neither can it be: for if we take it privatively, as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the grace of hope, in which sense it is a sinne, so the damned do not despair, for there is no promise of grace to them, and so its not their duty to hope, being they are now no longer under the day of Salvation; so that their despair is not a sinne. Indeed if we take despair negatively for being without all hope, so they do despair, but that is not their sinne, seeing God hath manifested there is no more hope for them, but part of that eternal misery which is in hell. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not necessary, that if Christ suffered the threatning for us he should despair.</p>
                  <p>But in the second place, It was necessary Christ should suffer the threatning for us, so farre as it could be without sinne, for otherwise he could not be our Mediatour, but he himself would have needed a Mediatour: Now to despair privatively is a sinne, and Christ could never be in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein he could say there was no hope for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as he had <hi>power to lay down his life, so also to take it up again;</hi> and as for the spiritual death of sinne, which was in the threatning, it could not stand with the holinesse and perfection of Christ to bear that; neither was it necessary, seeing that we did bear that in our own persons, being by nature dead in sins. The summe is this, That there was a miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in that threatning, though the Law said, <hi>Thou shalt die,</hi> yet it did not exclude another, it was not thou, and no other in thy room: therefore the wisdom of God found a way, whereby the Law for the matter of it might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and the mitigation was in respect of the person; so that <hi>alius solvit</hi> not <hi>aliud solvitur,</hi> its another that dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the debt, but it is not another debt if we speak of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Doubt.</note>To clear this, one doubt may be moved, <hi>If Christ did thus satisfie the Law, and so the Justice of God, then it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that he should do or suffer no more then the Law required, but Christs satisfaction was superabundant, and able to save more then it doth save, and was more pleasing to God in the way of obedience, then all our sins did displease God in the way of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>

                  <p>The Answer to this is,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> That if we respect the substance of Christs obedience and sufferings, he did no more then the Law required; The love of the Father would not suffer that more sufferings should be imposed on him then Justice requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: but if we regard circumstantials, as the dignity of his Person, and the cause of his sufferings, or servile obedience, so he did more then the Law required; for the Law did not require that the man who died should be God also, or that he should be without sinne, who thus suffered. Its true, The Law of a Mediatour required so, but that was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on him as Mediatour, which did not belong to us, and therefore the Apostle sheweth, <hi>Romans</hi> 5. that the grace of God by Christ, in respect of Justification is farre more then the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> in respect of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>In the ninth place, Against this imputation of Christs <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>9</label> active obedience, is objected two things, <hi>First, That by the same reason our sinnes should be imputed to Christ, and so he constituted a sinner, as we are righteous. And then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, This would make two formall causes of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> viz. <hi>Remission of sinne, and Imputation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we need not insist long on these; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> for the first is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently agitated in the controversie between Papists and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, and is already sufficiently discussed, so that there needs not much after-disquisition. For</p>
                  <p>First, Though our sinnes be imputed to Christ, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be called a sinner, because to be a sinner in the common ordinary use of the word, doth denote some inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent pravity and pollution. Thus when sinne is defined to be a transgression of the Law, it supposeth the subject in whom it is to erre from the Rule: Some denominations are from extrinsecall respects; some from intrinsecall motives; and thus for the most part the word sinner connoteth some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herency of defilement: Even as learned men observe, when they speak of the peenal infirmities of Christs Nature, they say not <hi>contraxit, sed assumpsit,</hi> he assumed them, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted them, because to contract an infirmity, doth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:118921:240"/> and rigidly denote so to take a thing, as to take the curse of it, and the natural inherent connexion of sinne, and such penalties. But to assume humane infirmities, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth onely he did partake of them in what manner and measure he pleased: Therefore because the word sinnes doth commonly sound in our ears, as one that hath some polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inexistent: Hence the consequence of denomination to be a sinner, may justly be denied to imputation of sinne, for this would confound imputation and inhesion, making them the same thing.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, If we will not manifestly confront plain and direct places of Scripture, we must needs grant, That our sinnes were imputed to him; for though <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.24. speak not of the word Imputation, yet they speak plainly the sense of that we mean by it in this controversie, <hi>Our sinnes are laid upon him, he bore our sinnes, He was made sinne;</hi> and if this were not so, Why, or, How could Christ die, and that in such an accursed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the Law? Death and curses are the wages of sinne; now these fell not upon Christ for his own sinne, therefore it must be for imputed sinne; And thus though that expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition be granted, <hi>he was made sinne for us,</hi> that is, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for sinne, yet it will evince this truth, for he could not be a Sacrifice for sinne, or be a Surety to expiate it, if it were not laid upon him, and he reputed of as so in his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, though in himself holy and unspotted: So that as it is with us, though we have the imputation of Christs righteousnesse, yet inherently we have filth, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of corruption; so though our sinnes were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto Christ, yet inwardly and inherently he was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely holy and innocent.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whereas its said, That with us imputation and inherency do not differ in reality, but onely <hi>quoad modum,</hi> he that is by imputation righteous, is as truly and as really righteous, as he that is inherently so; and therefore Christ must be as truly and really a sinner by imputation, as if it were by inhesion, its readily answered, That there is not the same reason of imputation of sinne to Christ, as there is of
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:118921:240"/> his righteousnesse to us; for sinne was imputed to him, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to his will, as a Surety to destroy and overcome it; Therefore he bore them, not so as to abide on him, but as to take them away: Even as he touched the unclean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (not as others, who thereby would be made unclean) but to remove and take away the leprosie: But the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Christ is communicated unto us, so as to abide on us, and to constitute us righteous thereby, Christ then being our Surety, and so undertaking the debt of our sinne, to discharge and cancell it, he cannot be thereby reputed a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but a vanquisher and conqueror of sin; and by this we see the weaknesse of that additional and auxiliary Argument, We are by <hi>Adams sinne</hi> imputed, made formally and truly sinners, Why then should not Christ by our sinnes imputed? for every eye may see a vast difference between the imputation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> sinne to us, and ours to Christ: To Christ it was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so that by this imputation he was to remove it; and he assumed this imputation voluntarily, thereby to destroy it; whereas <hi>Adams</hi> sinne is not only imputed to us by a natural necessity, supposing Gods antecedaneous appointment, but it is also so imputed to us, as to abide on us, to continue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. The summe is, That though our sinnes be imputed to Christ, yet he is not thereby constituted a sinner, as if for himself he suffered, or had offended God by this imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>AS for the second branch of the Objection propounded, viz. <hi>That this is to make a two-fold formal cause of our Justification,</hi> I have already sufficiently answered to the pretended absurdity thereof, yet that there may be full and heaped measure, I shall superadde; so that (as they say) <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissae loco,</hi> I farther answer,</p>
                  <p>First, That from the Doctrine of the imputation of Christs active obedience, it doth not necessarily follow, that there must be a two-fold formal cause of our Justification; for there are eminent and learned men, who do clearly and fully assert the imputation of Christs active obedience, and withall affirm, That remission of sinne is the effect and fruit of this imputation, adding withall that our whole Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation consists in our remission of sinne, the fruit of imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that imputation of Christs righteousnesse, is not a part, but cause of our Justification; So that with these, this Argument is as easily rejected, as it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded.</p>
                  <p>That solid and learned Authour <hi>Wallaeus (Epistol. ad</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinum.)
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:118921:241"/> being asked his judgement about <hi>Piscators</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as also the imputation of Christs active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, makes a threefold opinion amongst Writers in this point.</p>
                  <p>First, Of those who hold the imputation of Christs pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive righteousnesse, and the effect thereof, remission of sinne, the first part of Justification; and the imputation of Christs active righteousnesse, the effect whereof is acceptance to eternal life, and this is made the second part of Justification, and this opinion he saith is <hi>Beza</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>The second opinion holds the imputation of Christs active and passive righteousnesse: The effect whereof is said to be remission of sins, which is our whole Justification. This he ascribeth to <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third opinion affirmeth, the imputation of Christs passive righteousnesse onely, the effect whereof is said to be the remission of sinnes, which with them also is our whole Justification. And this is <hi>Piscators.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Wallaeus,</hi> though he thinketh the first and the second do not oppose one another, yet he adhereth to the second, as that which he judgeth most simple, and not too subtilly distinguishing causes and effects about Christs death. So that we see by this, that learned men may hold the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs active obedience, and yet not make Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have a two-fold formal cause: For (say they) <hi>our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification consists onely in remission of sinnes, which is the effect of the said imputation.</hi> And by the way, you may take notice of the weaknesse of that Argument so much insisted on by many, That <hi>Calvin</hi> did not hold the imputation of Christs active obedience, because he made Justification to consist wholly in remission of sinnes: For it may be granted, That <hi>Calvin</hi> held both, and yet did not contradict himself, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the imputation of Christs active obedience to be the cause; and remission of sinne, which he affirmeth to be our whole Justification, to be the effect thereof. Although (as I have shewed formerly) I cannot see any absurdity in asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a two-fold formal cause of our Justification, provided that they be not of a different nature and consideration.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this matter, We do not say, That Christs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:118921:242"/> obedience and passive, are the formal cause of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification; but the matter that is imputed to us thereunto, and indeed to speak properly, if we call them the formall cause, yet we cannot exactly say, of our Justification, but of our Evangelical righteousnesse; for Justification that is an action of God, which requireth a righteousnesse. This righteousnesse being Evangelical, consists of the active and passive obedience of Christ, which by the Covenant of grace is made ours, and God dealeth with us accordingly.</p>
                  <p>That I may at last come to an end, I shall encounter with the greatest, and most difficult of all their Objections; and if this may receive a true and solid Answer, all the rest will fall in that.</p>

                     </label> Its this, <hi>The Law bindeth either in respect of obedience, or in respect of penalty, If then there be not obedience to the Law, yet if the penalty be satisfied, then the Law can no more accuse, then we must needs stand justified: So that they will grant, Christ is our righteousnesse, they acknowledge the Law must be satisfied, and that is</hi> (say they) <hi>by Christs passive obedience; for if Christs death hath taken away the guilt, and yet we not accepted to eternal life, then there must be a</hi> medium <hi>between a man just and unjust, and that when the subject is properly capable of one of the contrary qualities, which is said to be as absurd, as if one thing were required to make a stick strait, and another thing not crooked.</hi>

                     </label> Two considerable points are in this Objection, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made two distinct Arguments by some.</p>
                  <p>The first is concerning the latitude or extension of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Law, whether it binde to obedience and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment disjunctively or copulatively.</p>
                  <p>The second is, when all the penalty is removed by a satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory righteousnesse through Christs death, Whether there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>ipso facto,</hi> without any imputation of a further righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, there be not an immediate right to eternal life.</p>
                  <p>For the former part <hi>Echart</hi> the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> who wrote a peculiar book against <hi>Piscator</hi> in this controversie, doth therein <hi>(Resp. ad decim. Arg.)</hi> shew, That <hi>Piscator</hi> did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim that Argument (though most of his fellows fervently
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:118921:242"/> propugne it) and grants, That the Law doth require both of us; obedience, as being our Lord and Master; and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being our Judge, who is to punish transgressors.</p>
                  <p>The true and solid Answer indeed to the former part is, That if we speak of man abiding in the state of integrity, so the Law did require onely obedience; for punishment it could not demand any, seeing there was no transgression, but if we consider man fallen, so the Law requireth both obedience and punishment; obedience properly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, but punishment occasionally and indirectly: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as then its said, That if the Law be satisfied in respect of the penal part, that then it requireth no more, and hath all the righteousnesse it expresseth, that is not upon any terms to be admitted: For Christ while he satisfied the Law in dying for us, did not answer the primary and principal end of the Law, which was <hi>To do this and live;</hi> but by his exact and perfect conformity unto it. So that this Argument proceedeth upon a mistake, as if it were all one to the Law, whether the debt of obedience, or the debt of punishment were paid; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly its the debt of obedience the Law doth principally aim at, and when the debt of punishment is paid, the debt of obedience is not thereby abrogated; for if it were so, then a man could not be said still to sinne, because Christ hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the punishment: But its so clear, that none ever yet denied it, that we do sinne, and whence is that? but because of that debt of obedience, which the Law still requireth. Neither is a man just by a bare suffering of the punishment of the Law, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is to be shewed.</p>
                  <p>Come we then to that which seemeth to be so hard a knot, that cannot be untied, and that is, <hi>If Christs bloud doth cleanse us from all sinne, then there needeth no imputation of a further righteousnesse, for seeing mans nature is a subject imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately susceptible, either of righteousnesse or unrighteousnesse, as the air is of darknesse or light; if so be all his sins be so washed away, that his unrighteousnesse is removed, then it must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow, he is accounted of by God as righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This hath exercised the Orthodox, so that they have given different Answers.</p>
                  <pb n="452" facs="tcp:118921:243"/>
                  <p>Some distinguish of sinnes, There are sinnes of omission and sinnes of commission: <hi>Now</hi> (say they) <hi>by Christs death we are freed from the sinnes of commission, but not omission; the sinnes of omission are covered by the active obedience of Christ.</hi> But I shall not adhere to this, partly, because the Scripture speaks universally, when it saith, our sinnes are purged away by the bloud of Christ; and partly, because in every sinne of commission, there is something of omission. I shall not here discusse that opinion of <hi>Cajetan,</hi> and some other School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, affirming, <hi>That the formal nature of a sinne of commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is some real and positive thing:</hi> Onely I shall at this time take it for granted, That in every sinne of commission, let it be conceived never so positive, yet there must be an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a privative omission of some rectitude that ought to be in it.</p>
                  <p>Others they distinguish of the guilt of sinne, they make it two-fold, the one is <hi>poena damni,</hi> as we deserve by it to be excluded from heaven; the other <hi>poena sensus,</hi> as by it we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all misery to be inflicted upon us: <hi>Now</hi> (say they) <hi>by Christs passive obedience the guilt of sinne,</hi> quoad poenam sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, <hi>is taken away, and by his active obedience the guilt of sinne,</hi> quoad poenam damni <hi>is removed:</hi> Neither, they say, is this Objection to the contrary, That in every rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture this two-fold respect of guilt is alwayes conjoyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for this is from Gods Decree without, and so they are thereby inseparable, yet for all that distinct. As a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive that is freed out of prison, and restored to his former honours; or a childe offending his father, upon reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath his punishment removed, and his right to the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance bestowed on him.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, there is a distinction made concerning Christs death. <hi>It is</hi> (say they) <hi>to be considered either</hi> quâ poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, <hi>as a punishment, or</hi> quâ actio, <hi>as an action proceeding from the love of God: Now if we consider it in the former respect, so its said to purge away sins of commission, and the punishment of sense; if in the later, so it takes away the sinnes of omission, and removeth the punishment of losse.</hi> But although there is truth in these distinctions, yet because the Scripture speaks abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and plainly in this matter, I think it not convenient to
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:118921:243"/> intangle the truth with these perplexities, nor to make so many distinctions and parcels in what Christ did for us; but look upon the whole course of his obedience, the last act whereof is eminently demonstrated in his death, as that which is the matter of our righteousnesse: So that its not necessary to adapt deliverance from sinne and hell to his death, or interest to eternall life and glory to his obedience: For although its plain, that those are two distinct mercies in themselves, as hath been shewed, and might have been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated one from another; yet now supposing the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and blessed order which God hath established, they can never be disjoyned, and so no wonder if one be put oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for the other. Although (I say) this be plain, yet the Scripture speaking of things as they are, and not what they might have been, and so not distinguishing, where yet in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual abstractions we may make a difference (as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in expressions about Gods providence respectively to evil actions, attributing them unto God indefinitly, when yet in our understanding, we must necessarily distinguish between the action and the obliquity of the action) its more conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to the Scripture custome, to say, that by Christ all sinnes under every differential respect, and all guilt under any notion is fully washed away by the Lord Christ, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we limit this either to his obedience in his life, or to his sufferings at his death, but unto the whole course of his subjection unto the Law of God; so that the full and satisfying Answer to this Objection is, That its granted, all sinnes of omission and commission, as also all punishment, whether <hi>damni</hi> or <hi>sensus</hi> is removed by Christ bloud; But we say, That by Christs bloud, or his death, is not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but necessarily included all his other parts of active obedience. This Interpretation we have already vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sufficiently; and certainly that place, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. where Christs obedience is mentioned even unto the death of the Crosse, doth compell a man to acknowledge that not onely obedience in his death, but all his former antecedaneous obedience eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> unto death, is part of that satisfactory righteousnesse which Christ obtained for us: So that this
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:118921:244"/> doth still deceive the learned opponents, that they look upon Christs death as oppositely to his active obedience, whereas the Scripture takes notice of it as the last and most signall act of his obedience conjunctly with all his former expressions thereof: So that we are not from thence to compute this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory obedience, as if hitherto he had been obeying for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but to behold the ultimate consummating thereof in his death. The Summe of all this is, That Christs active obedience disjoyned from his passive, is but part of that righteousnesse the Law requireth of man fallen; and also his passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence separated from his active is still but part: Therefore that we may have a compleat and full righteousnesse, it behoved us to have such a Surety who did perform both the debt of obedience, and also the debt of punishment for us.</p>
                  <p>So that from the Answer thus delivered, there is no necessity of falling upon that debate, Whether there be a middle estate between <hi>Justus</hi> and <hi>Injustus,</hi> (viz.) <hi>non Justus,</hi> yet because its so vehemently urged, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready said enough to that matter; onely let me adde, That the removing of sinne, and bestowing righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is not like the taking away the crookednesse of the line, and making it straight; for its plain, that is done by the same physicall motion; whereas I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That God might have pardoned sinne to a man, and yet not bestowed upon him such eternall Glory as he hath promised; So that eternall Glory followeth upon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sinne, not by a naturall causality, or resultancy, but by the gracious appointment and order of God, or if there should be some naturall concomitancy, yet that instance would not fitly resemble it, but this, When a man opens the window, and lets in light, the opening of the window, and the introduction of light proceed from two different principles, though the one followeth neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily upon the other: So that let it be granted, That if sinne be removed, righteousnesse must necessarily come in, yet that doth not follow, that its by the same motion: No, there may be one principle to remove sin as the <hi>obex</hi> and impediment, another to introduce and communicate the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse it self.</p>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:118921:244"/>
                  <p>If still it be urged, <hi>That a solution of the punishment of the Law is righteousnesse enough,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Answer, First, Let us not be afraid, lest we be made too rich, too righteous in Christ, Why should we be so indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious to straighten the righteousnesse Christ hath obtained for us, when the scope of the Scripture is to lengthen and heighten it as much as may be?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Even amongst men, none do account a meer suffering of the punishment of the Law, the righteousnesse of it; especially, when there are many superadded favours and priviledges of Grace promised to him, that doth not offend; Christ died not onely to redeem us out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but to invest us with all glorious dignity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Now the taking of the punishment doth not by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural consequence entitle to all that honour and dignity that the Scripture promiseth.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, This is not wholly inconsiderable, that if the paiment of the punishment of the Law, be all the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse Christ hath purchased for us, then we had a more noble and perfect righteousnesse in <hi>Adam,</hi> then Christ hath recovered for us, when yet <hi>Romans</hi> 5. the Apostle makes the Grace and Gift by the second <hi>Adam</hi> farre transcending the sinne and guilt which came by the first <hi>Adam.</hi> The consequence is clear, because <hi>Adams</hi> righteousnesse was a positive, and full conformity to the Law of God: But the righteousnesse Christ hath purchased for us, according to the sense of the Opponents, is onely a penal righteousnesse; The punishment is thereby removed, but obedience is not introduced.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have examined wherein the strength of those that dissent in this Point doth lie: Did I apprehend any thing else material, I would not wave the discussion of it, for its truth and the glory of Christ that we should aim at in these conflicts.</p>
                  <p>Now because not Arguments,<note place="margin">Antidotes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</note> but prejudices do sometimes obstruct the truth, I shall conclude all with some few Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes against them. As first, <hi>In the deciding of this controversie attend not the specious, and fair pretences of humane reason, for
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:118921:245"/> every thing of Christ is paradoxall to that;</hi> His Natures, his Offices, and his Passive Obedience in a satisfactory way to Gods Justice; and as the <hi>Socinians</hi> decry it as a thing against reason, for an innocent man to suffer in stead of a nocent; so they do not lesse exclaim against a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, because of anothers righteousnesse. This both Papists and <hi>Socinians</hi> rise up against, whereas we do not say, That a beleever is righteous, because Christ is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but because his righteousnesse, being our Surety, is made ours by Gods accounting of it to us; neither is it against presidents either in Scripture or humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, to have vertuous and laudable actions of some men, meritorious unto others that relate unto them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Consider whether this Doctrine doth not indeed give more Glory and Honour to Christ;</hi> For seeing he came into the world as a Surety for us, and so not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own personall obligation, but a voluntary assumed one, The more he did for us, the greater was his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and as it would not be honour enough to him to say, He died for our good, unlesse we affirm, in our stead: So neither that he obeyed the Law for our good, unlesse also we affirm, in our room.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Let this be seriously weighed, as hath been often hinted, Whether the same Arguments that destroy the active obedience of Christ, would not, if managed in a further way seem to overthrow the passive.</hi> Its farre from me to charge such consequences upon many of the learned Antagonists, onely its seriously to be considered, Whether that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity which is pleaded for by the Orthodox in respect of Christs satisfactory passive obedience, will not also as strongly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for his active: Doth not the Law of God, the justice of God equally relate to one as well as the other? And</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Doth not this provide more for the full consolation of a beleever? Are a godly mans temptations only about the punishment of the Law, who shall satisfie that, and not for the pure and holy obligation of the Law, who shall answer that? Let us be afraid to take off in the least manner, either from Christs glory, or the beleevers comfort.</p>
